**A practical guide for controls engineers and technicians**

<!-- [TOC] -->

## 1. Introduction

**Modbus Monitor XPF** is a versatile Windows application for facilitating communication between a Windows-based PC and Modbus Client or Server devices. It handles both Client (Master) and Server (Slave) operations and supports all common Modbus variants: TCP/IP, Serial RTU, Serial ASCII, and RTU/ASCII over TCP.

![Modbus Monitor XPF Main Interface](../../assets/screenshots/xpf/xpf-main-interface.png){ .screenshot-shadow loading="lazy" }

**One of the standout features** of Modbus Monitor XPF is its **dual functionality** - it encompasses both a Modbus Client and a Modbus Server **within a single application, running simultaneously**. This dual capability, combined with support for both Modbus Serial and Modbus TCP protocols, makes it an invaluable tool for various Modbus communication needs.

**What you can do with it:**

- Monitor live data from PLCs, drives, meters, and other Modbus devices ([Client Mode](#client-tab))
- Write values to registers and coils for testing or control ([Monitor Points Configuration](#7-monitor-points-configuration))
- Simulate Modbus devices for testing your own equipment ([Server Mode](#server-tab))
- Scan unknown devices to discover their register maps ([Scanner Group](#scanner-group))
- Log data for analysis and troubleshooting ([Log Group](#log-group))
- Validate register values against expected ranges ([Evaluate Group](#evaluate-group))
- **Run Client and Server modes simultaneously** on one PC

**Who this is for:**

- Controls engineers commissioning systems
- Maintenance technicians troubleshooting communications
- System integrators testing device compatibility  
- Equipment manufacturers validating Modbus implementations
- SCADA developers needing device simulation without physical hardware

### What Makes This Different

Most Modbus tools are either simple monitors or complex SCADA packages. XPF sits in the middle - it's powerful enough for serious work but simple enough to use quickly. The key advantages:

1. **Runs both Master and Slave simultaneously** - Test client-server interactions on one PC without physical devices
2. **Pre-built device maps** - Download factory-validated maps or community-contributed maps for common equipment
3. **Built-in data validation** - Automatic pass/fail testing with color coding
4. **Professional logging** - Proper timestamped records for troubleshooting
5. **Cross-platform protocol support** - Mix Modbus TCP, RTU, ASCII in the same session

**Modbus Map / List:** The Modbus Map (or Monitor Points List) is the complete collection of data points you want to communicate with on a Modbus device. Think of it as your “register shopping list” — a centralized view showing all Modbus addresses you plan to read or write. Each entry in this list includes its address, function code, data type, and optional pre- or post-processing settings. Together, these entries form a dictionary of Modbus data that defines what the XPF application will handle. XPF then automatically manages polling, writing, retries, data conversions, byte-swapping, and display formatting across the entire list.

**Monitor Point:** A Monitor Point is a single data entry within the Modbus Map — representing one Modbus register or coil you want to read or write. You configure its details (address, function code, data type, scaling, and optional pre/post-processing). Each Monitor Point operates as an independent tag, allowing you to precisely define what data you want and how it should be processed. XPF then performs all background operations for that point: polling, retrying, converting, swapping bytes if needed, and displaying formatted values.

    **Understanding the relationship between Modbus Map and Monitor Points:**
    
    | NAME | ADDRESS | UNIT ID | GAIN | OFFSET | DATA TYPE | SWAP TYPE | VALUE |
    |------|---------|---------|------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
    | Motor Speed | `400001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | UINT16 | ABCD_BE | 1450 |
    | Line Voltage | `300001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | INT16 | ABCD_BE | 230 |
    | Pump Status | `100001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | BIT | ABCD_BE | 1 |
    | Coil Register | `000001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | BIT | ABCD_BE | 1 |
    
    **Key Points:**
    
    - The **entire table above** represents your **Modbus Map/List**
    - **Each row** (e.g., Motor Speed, Line Voltage) represents one **Monitor Point**
    - Each Monitor Point has all 8 columns: NAME, ADDRESS (6-digit), UNIT ID, GAIN, OFFSET, DATA TYPE, SWAP TYPE, VALUE
    - Address format: `4xxxxx`=Holding Reg | `3xxxxx`=Input Reg | `1xxxxx`=Discrete Input | `0xxxxx`=Coil

    **Server Mode Flow:**
    
    1. **Configure Server Data** - Set up registers, coils, and initial values
    2. **External master sends request** - SCADA/HMI asks for data
    3. **XPF processes request** - Validates function code, address range
    4. **XPF sends response** - Provides requested data or write confirmation
    5. **Log transaction** - Track all requests for analysis

    **Use Cases:** Simulate devices for testing, act as protocol gateway, development without hardware

!!! tip "Simultaneous Operation - Run Both Modes Together"
    **XPF can operate as Client AND Server at the same time:**
    
    - **Client mode** reads data from real PLCs (Modbus TCP on port 502)
    - **Server mode** provides that data to SCADA (Modbus RTU on COM1)
    - Each mode uses independent interface configuration
    - Perfect for protocol conversion, testing, or acting as a data bridge

**Magic Codes:** Special text you add to the **Name** field of monitor points to enable advanced features like custom poll rates, bit field access, string length control, and date/time conversion (covered in detail in [Monitor Points Configuration](#7-monitor-points-configuration) section).

**Dual Functionality:** XPF can operate as both Client and Server simultaneously, making it ideal for testing client-server interactions on a single PC without physical devices.

!!! tip "Workflow Best Practice"
    1. Set up your monitor points first (define what you want to read/write)
    2. Configure communication settings (TCP/Serial, timeouts)
    3. Save your configuration before starting polling
    4. Test with "Read Once" before enabling continuous polling
    5. Save frequently - especially before making major changes

#### Key Concepts

**Modbus Map / List:** The Modbus Map (or Monitor Points List) is the complete collection of data points you want to communicate with on a Modbus device. Think of it as your "register shopping list" — a centralized view showing all Modbus addresses you plan to read or write. Each entry in this list includes its address, function code, data type, and optional pre- or post-processing settings. Together, these entries form a dictionary of Modbus data that defines what the XPF application will handle. XPF then automatically manages polling, writing, retries, data conversions, byte-swapping, and display formatting across the entire list. See [Monitor Points Configuration](#7-monitor-points-configuration) for complete setup details.

**Monitor Point:** A Monitor Point is a single data entry within the Modbus Map — representing one Modbus register or coil you want to read or write. You configure its details (address, function code, data type, scaling, and optional pre/post-processing). Each Monitor Point operates as an independent tag, allowing you to precisely define what data you want and how it should be processed. XPF then performs all background operations for that point: polling, retrying, converting, swapping bytes if needed, and displaying formatted values.

    **Understanding the relationship between Modbus Map and Monitor Points:**
    
    | NAME | ADDRESS | UNIT ID | GAIN | OFFSET | DATA TYPE | SWAP TYPE | VALUE |

    | Motor Speed | `400001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | UINT16 | ABCD_BE | 1450 |
    | Line Voltage | `300001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | INT16 | ABCD_BE | 230 |
    | Pump Status | `100001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | BIT | ABCD_BE | 1 |
    | Coil Register | `000001` | 1 | 1.00000 | 0.00000 | BIT | ABCD_BE | 1 |

    - **Validation**: Ensures valid combinations of function codes and data types
    - **Guided Setup**: Dropdown menus prevent common configuration errors
    - **No Syntax Errors**: Automatically formats addresses and codes correctly
    - **Beginner Friendly**: Visual interface easier than memorizing Modbus specifications
    - **Quick Changes**: Faster than navigating table columns for adjustments

#### List Group

**Add and Remove Points** - Add, remove, or modify monitor points in bulk. Change addressing modes (0-based/1-based), swap Unit IDs globally, or set decimal precision for all numeric displays.

The **List Group** provides essential tools for managing your Monitor Points (also called Rows or Items) in the configuration table:

| Button | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Add** | Add new point | Creates new row with default values. Automatically **increments address by one** from the last row for quick sequential entry. |
| **Remove** | Delete selected point(s) | Removes selected monitor point(s) from the table. Select multiple with `Ctrl+Click` (non-sequential) or `Shift+Click` (range). |
| **Delete All** | Clear entire list | Removes **ALL monitor points** from the table. **Use with caution** - this action cannot be undone! |
| **Offset** | Toggle address base | Switch between **1-based** (1-65536) and **0-based** (0-65535) addressing for all addresses in the list. |
| **Swap ID** | Change Unit ID globally | Updates **Unit ID** (Slave/Station ID) for **all monitor points** at once. Useful when reconfiguring for a different device. |
| **Decimal Places** | Set display precision | Configure the number of decimal places for displaying numeric values throughout the application. |

!!! example "Typical Workflow"
    **Adding multiple consecutive registers:**
    
    1. Add first register at address 400001
    2. Click **Add (+)** - automatically creates 400002
    3. Click **Add (+)** again - creates 400003
    4. Continue as needed - each Add increments by one
    
    **Bulk ID changes:**
    
    - If you need to change all monitor points from Slave ID 1 to Slave ID 5
    - Simply click **ID** button and enter 5
    - All monitor points update immediately

#### Filter Group

**Search and Filter Monitor Points** - Search Name and Address fields to quickly locate specific monitor points. Filter large lists by text search or Unit ID to focus on relevant registers during troubleshooting or configuration.

![Filter Interface](../../assets/screenshots/xpf/xpf-home-filter.png){ .screenshot-shadow loading="lazy" }

**Filter Components:**

| Label | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | **Row Index**| Shows the **index of the currently selected row**. Especially useful when the list is filtered to know the true row number. -1 when none Selected.|
| **2** | **Filter Text Box** | Enter text to search. Filters all **Name** and **Address** fields that contain the entered text. |
| **3** | **Total Rows** | Shows the **total number of rows** in the current view (filtered or full list). |
| **4** | **Clear Filter**| Clears the text filter and shows all rows in the list. |
| **5** | **Clear ID** | Clears the ID filter and shows all rows in the list. |
| **6** | **ID Dropdown** | Select **Unit ID** (Slave ID or Station ID) to filter by device. Combine with text filter for precise results. |


!!! tip "How Filtering Works"
    **Text Search:**
    - Type any text in the filter box
    - Results show all monitor points where Name OR Address contains your search text
    - Case-insensitive search
    - Use partial matches (e.g., "temp" finds "Temperature", "temp_sensor", "Water Temp")
    
    **ID Filter:**
    - Select specific Unit ID from dropdown
    - Shows only monitor points for that device
    - Combine with text filter for double-filtering
    
    **Combined Example:**
    - Filter Text: `status`
    - ID: `3`
    - Result: Only status-related registers from Unit ID 3

!!! example "Common Filter Scenarios"
    **Finding all temperature sensors:**
    ```
    Filter Box: temp
    Result: Shows all points with "temp" in name or address
    ```
    
    **Working with specific device:**
    ```
    ID Dropdown: 5
    Result: Shows only Slave ID 5 registers
    ```
    
    **Precise targeting:**
    ```
    Filter Box: alarm
    ID Dropdown: 2
    Result: All alarm-related points from device 2 only
    ```

#### Evaluate Group Details

**Value Validation and Testing** - Validate register values against configurable limits with automatic color coding. Set pass/fail thresholds for quality control testing or equipment health monitoring.

Change the background colors of the Value cell based on the High, Low, and Nominal Limits. **Quickly validate the value from the Modbus device and test to see if it is within the valid range.**

| **Value ≥ High Limit** | Out-of-Range High | Red | Value cell background turns red |
| **Low Limit < Value < High Limit** | Normal/Nominal | Green | Value cell background turns green |
| **Value ≤ Low Limit** | Out-of-Range Low | Blue | Value cell background turns blue |
| **Evaluate OFF** | Not Evaluated | Gray | Value cell shows normal (no color) |

**Common Workflows:**

=== "Capture Baseline"

    **Objective:** Establish High/Low limits by observing real device behavior
    
    1. Click **Test/Evaluate** button to turn ON evaluation
    2. Click **Show** to display filter controls
    3. Let device run under normal conditions while observing values
    4. When value reaches maximum safe level, select that row and click **Save as High Limit**
    5. When value reaches minimum safe level, select that row and click **Save as Low Limit**
    6. Verify status shows Green (Nominal) for normal operations
    7. Result: Limits are now calibrated to your specific equipment

=== "Troubleshoot Single Equipment"

    **Objective:** Quickly identify out-of-spec registers on a single device
    
    1. Verify **Test/Evaluate** is ON
    2. Click **Show** to display filters
    3. Select the **Auto** toggle to enable automatic updates
    4. Toggle **High Filter** to see only values exceeding maximum
    5. Investigate displayed registers - these indicate overtemperature, overpressure, overspeed, etc.
    6. Toggle **Low Filter** to check values below minimum (undertemp, low pressure, low speed)
    7. Use color coding as visual guide: Red=High, Blue=Low, Green=Normal
    8. Result: Problematic registers highlighted for investigation

=== "Commissioning Quality Control"

    **Objective:** Validate new equipment meets specifications before deployment
    
    1. Import manufacturer specifications into High/Low/Nominal limits for each register
    2. Click **Test/Evaluate** to turn ON
    3. Click **Auto** to enable automatic filter updates
    4. Run equipment through full operating range (startup, normal, shutdown)
    5. Observe color changes:
       - Green throughout = Pass ✓
       - Red or Blue = Out of spec = Fail ✗
    6. Adjust equipment settings if limits exceeded
    7. Re-run until all registers stay Green during full cycle
    8. Result: Equipment validated and ready for production deployment

**Troubleshooting:**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **No colors appearing** | Test/Evaluate is OFF | Click Test/Evaluate button to toggle ON |
| **Colors not updating** | Auto is disabled | Click Auto toggle to enable automatic updates, or manually toggle filters |
| **Wrong limits set** | Previous calibration incorrect | Select row, click Save as High/Low to capture new values, or edit limits manually |
| **Filter not working** | Show button is OFF, filters hidden | Click Show button to display High/Low/Nominal/Auto controls |
| **String evaluation fails** | Mismatched case or spacing | For strings, High Limit and Low Limit must be identical and match exactly (case-sensitive) |

**Tips & Best Practices:**

- ✅ **Use Auto toggle** for real-time monitoring - colors update automatically as data changes
- ✅ **Save values during normal operation** - Use Save as High/Low when equipment is running at actual min/max
- ✅ **Combine with Filter** - Focus investigation on out-of-spec registers only
- ✅ **Document limits** - Save your CSV configuration file after setting limits for reuse on other devices
- ✅ **Color-code by status** - Customize Nominal/High/Low colors to match your facility standards
- ❌ **Don't manually type limits for exact values** - Use Save buttons for precision, avoid rounding errors

**Evaluate Limits Settings (Per Monitor Point)**

Fine-tune validation thresholds for individual monitor points. Each point can have custom limits and color coding independent of others in your list.

![Evaluate Settings](../../assets/screenshots/xpf/xpf-home-evaluate.png){ loading="lazy" }

Click the **three dots (...)** button at the end of any monitor point row to open the Evaluate Limits dialog shown above.

|Label | Setting | Options | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
|**1**| **Three Dots (...)** | Button | Opens the Evaluate Limits settings dialog for this monitor point |
|**2**| **Evaluate** | Checkbox | Turn the Evaluate feature **on or off** for this specific monitor point |
|**3**| **Nominal Color** | Color picker | Choose a color for the **Nominal Value range**. The nominal range is calculated as values **between the Low Limit and High Limit**. |
|**4**| **Low Limit** | Value + Color | Choose a color to highlight the Value column when the value **equals or falls below the Low Limit**. The value can be **numerical or string** type. |
|**5**| **High Limit** | Value + Color | Choose a color to highlight the Value column when the value **equals or exceeds the High Limit**. The value can be **numerical or string** type. |
|**4 + 5**| **String Mode** | Same High/Low | For String Data Type, set the **same High and Low Limit** for exact string matching |

!!! example "Practical Applications"
    **Quality Control Testing:**
    
    - Set High Limit: 100, Low Limit: 0, Nominal: Green
    - Values 0-100 show green (pass)
    - Values outside range show red/yellow (fail)
    - Instant visual validation during production testing
    
    **Equipment Health Monitoring:**
    
    - Motor temperature: High=80°C (Red), Low=10°C (Blue), Nominal=Green
    - Pressure sensor: High=150 PSI (Red), Nominal=Green
    - Quick identification of out-of-spec conditions
    
    **String Validation:**
    
    - Device status should be "RUNNING"
    - Set High Limit = Low Limit = "RUNNING", Nominal Color = Green
    - Any other status shows as error color

##### Best Practices

!!! tip "Logging Best Practices"
    **Optimize Your Workflow:**
    
    - **Save Before Logging**: Enable the **Save** toggle before starting long monitoring sessions
    - **Filter Proactively**: Use **Errors** toggle during troubleshooting to reduce noise
    - **Clear Regularly**: Click **Clear** between test runs to avoid confusion
    - **Text Search**: Use specific keywords (register address, function code, device name) for precise filtering
    - **Quick Access**: Add **Show** and **Clear** to Quick Access Toolbar for rapid access
    - **Project Auto-Start**: Saved projects remember logging state - automatically resumes if it was active

!!! warning "Performance Impact"
    **Resource Considerations:**
    
    - Event logging consumes **CPU cycles** and **memory** to capture high-speed communication
    - **High poll rates** (many registers per second) increase logging overhead significantly
    - **Disable logging** when not actively troubleshooting for optimal performance
    - **Clear logs periodically** during long sessions to free memory
    - **Text filtering** searches all entries in real-time - may slow down with thousands of entries
    
    **Recommendation:** Turn off logging during normal production operation unless you need historical records.

!!! info "Data Persistence"
    **What Gets Saved:**
    
    - **With Save Toggle ON**: Log file continuously updated in Documents folder
    - **With Save Toggle OFF**: Logs exist only in memory, cleared when:
        - You click **Clear** button
        - You close XPF application
        - You switch to another configuration file
    
    **File Location:** Check your Windows Documents folder for auto-saved log files (typically named with timestamp).

    Stop Bits: 1                # 1 or 2 bits
    Protocol Options: Default/RTU/ASCII
    ```

### Timeout Settings

Critical timing parameters for reliable communication - **these settings are crucial for optimizing communication efficiency**:

| Parameter | Default | Range | Purpose & Impact |
|-----------|---------|-------|------------------|
| **Response Timeout** | 3000ms | 0-65535ms | Duration to gather all bytes from remote server including complete Modbus frame up to CRC. **Too short = false timeouts, too long = slow error detection** |
| **Inter-Frame Delay** | 20ms | 0-65535ms | Wait time between each monitor point in the list. **Prevents overwhelming slow devices or networks** |
| **Poll Rate** | 1000ms | 0-65535ms | Delay before scanning entire list again. **Controls overall polling frequency**. **WARNING: Setting to 0 may cause UI slowdown/freezing as continuous polling impacts UI responsiveness. Recommended minimum: 20ms** |
| **Retries** | 3 | 1-65535 | Number of retry attempts for failed requests. **Higher values improve reliability on unreliable networks but increase error recovery time** |

!!! tip "Timeout Optimization by Environment"
    **Fast Local Networks (LAN):**
    ```yaml
    Response Timeout: 1000ms    # Quick response expected
    Inter-Frame Delay: 5ms      # Minimal delay needed
    Poll Rate: 500ms           # Fast refresh rate
    ```
    
    **Slow Serial Connections:**
    ```yaml
    Response Timeout: 5000ms    # Allow for slow serial transmission
    Inter-Frame Delay: 50ms     # Prevent serial buffer overrun
    Poll Rate: 2000ms          # Reduce load on serial device
    ```
    
    **WAN/Internet Connections:**
    ```yaml
    Response Timeout: 10000ms   # Account for network latency
    Inter-Frame Delay: 100ms    # Prevent network congestion
    Poll Rate: 5000ms          # Conservative refresh rate
    ```

!!! warning "Critical Timing Considerations"
    These parameters directly affect:

    - **Network traffic management** - Higher delays = less network load
    - **Error detection speed** - Longer timeouts = slower fault detection  
    - **System responsiveness** - Shorter poll rates = more responsive but higher load
    - **Device compatibility** - Some devices need specific timing requirements

### Write Operations

Control how XPF handles value changes in the Value column:

| Mode | Function | Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Disabled** | Read Only | Value changes revert on next scan |
| **Auto** | Smart Write | Automatically selects single/multiple write functions |
| **Manual** | Function Select | Choose specific Modbus write function codes |

**Write Function Codes:**

- **Function 5 (0x05)**: Write Single Coil
- **Function 6 (0x06)**: Write Single Register  
- **Function 15 (0x0F)**: Write Multiple Coils
- **Function 16 (0x10)**: Write Multiple Registers

### Scanner - Modbus Address Discovery Tool

**Poll remote server to discover new Modbus Addresses or build Modbus Map for devices without public Modbus Maps.** This is invaluable when Modbus Maps are unknown or unavailable from manufacturers.

**Scanner Configuration Parameters:**

| # | Field | Format | Description |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | **Start** | 6-digit format | Start Address to begin scanner (e.g., 400001 for holding registers) |
| **2** | **Regs** | Number | Number of registers or polls to serially scan consecutively |
| **3** | **Data** | Data Type | Assumed Data Type. The program **automatically calculates** the number of registers (1, 2, 4) to request depending on the Data Type selected |
| **4** | **Swap** | Swap Type | Data Swap for 32-bit or 64-bit data values (ABCD, CDBA, BADC, CDAB) |
| **5** | **ID** | Byte (1-247) | Server ID (Slave ID) to start scanning |

**Scanner Process:**

1. **Configure** the range and parameters above
2. **Click "Start"** to begin systematic polling of consecutive addresses
3. **Monitor** results in real-time as scanner tests each address
4. **Valid responses** are automatically added to monitor points list
5. **Invalid addresses** are skipped (no response or error)

!!! example "Typical Scanner Usage"
    **Scenario: Unknown PLC registers**
    
    - Start: 400001 (Holding registers)
    - Regs: 100 (scan 100 consecutive registers)
    - Data: INT16 (assume 16-bit values)
    - Swap: ABCD_BE (big-endian)
    - ID: 1 (slave device 1)
    
    Scanner will poll 400001 through 400100, adding responsive registers to your monitor points list automatically.

### Charts - Data Trends Visualization

- **Different Units**: Speed (RPM) vs Current (Amps) vs Temperature (°C)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Compare process variables with different scales

**Configuration Strategy:**

```yaml
Axis 0 (Left) - Process Variables:
  - Temperature: 0-150°C
  - Flow Rate: 0-500 GPM
  - Level: 0-100%

Axis 1 (Right) - Electrical Variables:
  - Motor Current: 0-50 Amps
  - Power: 0-100 kW
  - Frequency: 0-60 Hz
```

##### Real-Time Performance Optimization

**Game-Changing Feature:** XPF's most powerful capability is running **one network server (TCP or UDP) plus multiple serial servers simultaneously** - a revolutionary approach that **saves significant time and eliminates the need for extra hardware**.

**Traditional Approach vs. XPF Multi-Server:**

| Traditional Method | XPF Multi-Server Approach | Savings |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Multiple PCs/devices needed | **Single XPF instance** | **Hardware cost elimination** |
| Separate software licenses | **One XPF license** | **Licensing cost reduction** |
| Complex setup coordination | **Unified configuration** | **Setup time reduction (hours → minutes)** |
| Multiple maintenance points | **Single point of control** | **Maintenance simplification** |

**What XPF Can Run Simultaneously:**

=== "Network Servers (TCP or UDP)"

    **Single Network Interface - Choose TCP OR UDP:**
    
    ```yaml
    # Choose ONE network interface per XPF instance:
    TCP Server:       Port 502 (Standard Modbus TCP)
    OR
    UDP Server:       Port 502 (Standard Modbus UDP)
    
    # With protocol variants:
    TCP + RTU:        Port 502 (Modbus RTU over TCP)
    TCP + ASCII:      Port 502 (Modbus ASCII over TCP)
    UDP + RTU:        Port 502 (Modbus RTU over UDP)  
    UDP + ASCII:      Port 502 (Modbus ASCII over UDP)
    ```
    
    **Network Interface Limitation:**
    - **TCP OR UDP**: Cannot run TCP and UDP servers simultaneously in single XPF instance
    - **Protocol Options**: Can select Default, RTU, or ASCII over chosen interface
    - **Multiple Instances**: Use separate XPF instances for TCP and UDP if both needed
    - **Development efficiency** - switch protocols without hardware changes

=== "Serial Servers (COM Ports)"

    **Multiple COM Ports, Independent Settings:**
    
    ```yaml
    # All running simultaneously:
    COM1: 9600 baud,   8,N,1 (Standard RTU - Legacy devices)
    COM3: 19200 baud,  8,N,1 (High-speed RTU - Modern PLCs)
    COM4: 115200 baud, 8,N,1 (Ultra-fast RTU - Performance testing)
    COM5: 1200 baud,   7,E,1 (ASCII protocol - Historical systems)
    ```
    
    **Hardware Elimination:**
    - **No multiple test devices** needed
    - **No serial multiplexers** required  
    - **No additional COM port expansion cards**
    - **USB-to-serial adapters** provide unlimited COM ports

=== "Mixed Interface Deployment"

    **Network + Serial Simultaneously:**
    
    ```yaml
    # Single XPF instance supports:
    TCP Server:    Port 502    (Ethernet clients)
    AND
    COM1 RTU:      9600 baud   (Legacy serial devices)
    COM3 RTU:      19200 baud  (Modern serial devices)
    COM5 ASCII:    1200 baud   (ASCII protocol testing)
    
    # OR alternatively:
    UDP Server:    Port 502    (UDP clients)
    AND  
    COM1 RTU:      9600 baud   (Legacy serial devices)
    COM3 RTU:      19200 baud  (Modern serial devices)
    ```
    
    **Interface Capabilities:**
    - **One Network + Multiple Serial** - TCP OR UDP plus multiple COM ports
    - **Network Choice** - Select either TCP or UDP (not both simultaneously)
    - **Unlimited Serial** - Support for multiple COM ports with independent settings

### Advanced Server Features

#### Capture - Modbus Map Traffic Sniffer

**Effortlessly sniff Modbus Map traffic from connected clients and automatically build Modbus Maps.** This feature is invaluable when Modbus Maps are unknown or unavailable from manufacturers, providing a way to discover the addresses the Modbus Master is using.

**How It Works:**

When enabled, the Capture feature monitors incoming Modbus requests from clients and automatically creates monitor points based on those requests. This "learns" the Modbus map by observing real communication.

**Capture Settings:**

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **On** | Enable | Enable the addition of Modbus Monitoring points based on Modbus Requests. **Note**: The server must be running for this feature to work. |
| **Off** | Disable | Disable the Capture or Modbus Traffic sniffer |
| **Default Value 0** | Fill with zero | Fill **"0"** as the value into the newly created Modbus Map entries |
| **Auto Value** | Fill with address | Use the **Modbus Register address as the fill value** for newly created entries |

**Use Cases:**

1. **Reverse Engineering**: When you don't have documentation for a Modbus device   
      - Start XPF Server on same network/port
      - Let existing client connect and communicate
      - XPF captures all register accesses automatically
      - Result: Complete Modbus map discovered from live traffic

2. **System Analysis**: Understanding existing Modbus networks   
      - Place XPF between client and server (monitoring mode)
      - Capture reveals which registers are actually used
      - Identify active vs. unused registers

3. **Protocol Validation**: Testing client implementations   
      - Enable capture while your client polls the server
      - Verify client is requesting correct registers
      - Check function codes and access patterns

!!! tip "Capture Best Practices"

    - **Start with clean list**: Clear monitor points before enabling capture
    - **Use Default Value 0**: Easier to identify newly captured points
    - **Let it run**: Allow all client operations to complete for full map
    - **Review results**: Captured points may need refinement (names, data types)
    - **Save immediately**: Export captured map before making changes

devices/+/data/#             # All data from all devices

# Combined wildcards
site/+/equipment/#           # All equipment data from all sites
```

**Topic Best Practices:**

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Use logical hierarchy (site/building/equipment/measurement)
- **Lowercase**: Stick to lowercase for consistency
- **Descriptive**: Use clear, self-documenting topic names
- **Avoid Spaces**: Use underscores or hyphens instead (`device_1` not `device 1`)
- **Limit Depth**: Keep hierarchy under 7 levels for manageability

!!! tip "Testing Topics"
    Subscribe to `#` (all topics) temporarily to see all broker activity, but remove this before production use as it consumes bandwidth and memory.

### Publishing Messages

Send test messages or publish data to MQTT topics.

**Publish Controls:**

1. **Select Topic**: Enter or select target topic in Topic ComboBox
2. **Click Send**: Publishes a test message to the selected topic
3. **Verify**: Check Console or external MQTT client to confirm message receipt

**Publishing Workflow:**

```
Step 1: Enter topic     → test/modbusmonitor
Step 2: Click Send      → Message published
Step 3: Verify Console  → Confirm TX count increased
```

!!! note "Message Content"
    The **Send** button publishes a sample/test message. For publishing actual Modbus data to MQTT topics, configure topic mapping in the main application settings.

### Console and Debug Logging

Monitor MQTT communication and diagnose connection issues with the built-in console and logging features.

**Two Types of Logging Available:**

1. **General Communication Log** (Home Tab > Log > Show)
   - Overall application communication status
   - All protocol communications (Modbus, MQTT, etc.)
   - General connection and error information

2. **MQTT-Specific Debug Log** (IoT Tab > MQTT Group > Debug Log Button)
   - Detailed MQTT-only information
   - Connection handshake details, TLS certificate validation
   - MQTT protocol-specific messages and authentication
   - Message publishing/subscription confirmation

**Console Features:**

| **Debug Log Button** | IoT Tab > MQTT Group | Enable MQTT-specific debug logging | Detailed MQTT protocol troubleshooting |
| **Message Display** | Console window | Timestamped entries | Shows TX (transmitted) and RX (received) messages |

**What Gets Logged:**

**General Log (Home Tab > Log):**
- Overall application status and errors
- General connection events across all protocols
- Basic MQTT connection status ("Connected", "Disconnected")

**MQTT Debug Log (IoT Tab > MQTT Group > Debug Log):**
- **Connection Events**: Connected, disconnected, reconnection attempts with detailed handshake
- **TLS/SSL Information**: Certificate validation, encryption protocol details
- **Authentication**: Username/password validation, certificate authentication
- **Published Messages**: Topics and payloads sent (TX) with timestamps
- **Received Messages**: Topics and payloads received (RX) with confirmation
- **Protocol Details**: MQTT configuration, QoS levels, keep-alive status
- **Errors**: Connection failures, authentication errors, timeouts with specific error codes

**Debug Log Usage:**

**For General Troubleshooting:**
1. Enable **Home Tab** > **Log** > **Show** and click **Start**
2. Monitor overall application communication status

**For MQTT-Specific Issues:**
1. Enable **IoT Tab** > **MQTT Group** > **Debug Log** and click **Start**
2. Perform MQTT operations (connect, subscribe, publish)
3. Review detailed MQTT protocol information including TLS handshake and authentication
4. Monitor message publishing confirmation and subscription status
5. Disable logging after troubleshooting to reduce overhead

!!! tip "When to Use Each Log"
    - **General Log**: Use for overall connectivity issues, basic status monitoring
    - **MQTT Debug Log**: Use for MQTT-specific problems like TLS issues, authentication failures, message delivery problems

### Connection Status and Counters

Monitor MQTT connection health and message statistics.

**Status Indicators:**

| Indicator | Location | Information Displayed |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|

### Troubleshooting

#### Connection Issues

**Cannot Connect to Broker:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Hostname not resolving | Verify DNS resolution, try IP address instead |
| Connection timeout | Check firewall rules, verify broker is running, increase timeout value |
| Port blocked | Verify network allows outbound traffic on MQTT ports (1883, 8883) |
| Wrong protocol | Match protocol version to broker (3.1.1 vs 5.0) |

**Quick Test:**

```powershell
# Test basic connectivity (Windows PowerShell)
Test-NetConnection broker.hivemq.com -Port 1883

# Test with telnet
telnet broker.hivemq.com 1883
```

#### Authentication Failures

**Username/Password Rejected:**

- Verify credentials are correct (check for typos, case sensitivity)
- Confirm broker requires authentication (try without credentials first)
- Check broker logs for specific auth failure reasons

**Certificate Authentication Failed:**

- Verify certificate files are correct format (PEM, PFX)
- Check certificate hasn't expired
- Ensure certificate CN/SAN matches broker hostname
- Verify client certificate is authorized by broker CA
- Check file permissions (can application read certificate files?)

#### Message Delivery Issues

**Messages Not Arriving:**

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Wrong topic | Verify subscribed topic matches published topic |
| Wildcard mismatch | Check wildcard usage (+, #) matches topic structure |
| QoS mismatch | Verify broker/client QoS settings compatible |
| Not connected | Ensure connection status shows "Connected" |
| Buffer overflow | Check if too many messages overwhelming client |

**Subscription Problems:**

- Confirm subscriptions active (Subscribe button clicked after adding topics)
- Check subscription count indicator on Subscribe button
- Verify topic names (no trailing spaces, correct case)
- Review broker logs for subscription rejections

#### Console Issues

**Console Empty or Not Updating:**

- Enable **Log** toggle to see debug information
- Verify messages are actually being sent/received (check broker logs)
- Click **Console** button to ensure window is visible
- Check filter settings if console view is filtered

### Common Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Remote Monitoring

**Scenario**: Monitor industrial equipment from remote locations via cloud MQTT broker.

**Setup:**

1. Configure XPF to poll Modbus devices locally
2. Connect to cloud MQTT broker (AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub)
3. Map Modbus register values to MQTT topics
4. Publish data at regular intervals
5. Subscribe remote dashboard/mobile app to same topics

**Benefits:**
- Real-time remote visibility
- Historical data collection
- Alert notifications
- Multi-site monitoring

#### Use Case 2: Data Aggregation

**Scenario**: Collect data from multiple factory sites to central analytics platform.

**Architecture:**

```
Site 1: Modbus → XPF → MQTT → Cloud Broker
Site 2: Modbus → XPF → MQTT → Cloud Broker
Site 3: Modbus → XPF → MQTT → Cloud Broker
                                    ↓
                          Analytics Platform
```

#### Use Case 3: Bi-directional Control

**Scenario**: Monitor Modbus devices and receive control commands from cloud.

**Topics:**

- **Publish**: `factory/line1/plc/data` (sensor readings)
- **Subscribe**: `factory/line1/plc/commands` (setpoint changes)

**Workflow:**

1. XPF polls Modbus devices, publishes data to MQTT
2. Cloud application analyzes data
3. Cloud publishes control commands to command topics
4. XPF receives commands, writes to Modbus devices

### FAQ

**Q: What MQTT versions are supported?**  
A: Select from the Version dropdown: 3.1, 3.1.1 (most common), and 5.0 (latest). Use 3.1.1 unless your broker specifically requires a different version.

**Q: Do I need to provide a Client ID?**  
A: Yes, always use a unique Client ID for each connected instance. Some brokers accept empty IDs and generate temporary IDs, but using unique IDs prevents connection conflicts and enables persistent sessions.

**Q: What certificate formats are accepted?**  
A: Common formats include PEM (`.crt`, `.pem`) for CA certificates, and PFX/PKCS12 (`.pfx`, `.p12`) for client certificates with private keys. Some brokers also support separate certificate and key files.

**Q: Can I connect to multiple brokers simultaneously?**  
A: The current implementation supports one broker connection at a time. To connect to multiple brokers, run multiple instances of XPF or use a broker bridge/federation.

**Q: How do I map Modbus data to MQTT topics?**  
A: Topic mapping configuration is available in the IoT tab settings. Detailed documentation for topic mapping will be added in a future update.

**Q: What happens if the connection drops?**  
A: XPF automatically attempts to reconnect using the configured timeout and keep-alive settings. Check the connection status indicator and console logs for reconnection activity.

**Q: Is there a message size limit?**  
A: MQTT protocol supports up to 256MB per message, but practical limits depend on your broker configuration and network. Most implementations limit messages to 1-10MB.

**Q: Can I use wildcards when publishing?**  
A: No, wildcards (`+`, `#`) are only supported for subscriptions. Publishing requires a specific topic without wildcards.

## 7. Monitor Points Configuration

**Monitor Points** are similar to PLC tags - each one represents a specific data point you want to read or write on a Modbus device. Just as PLC tags map to memory addresses in a controller, Monitor Points map to Modbus registers and coils with all the configuration needed to access and interpret the data correctly.

This section explains everything you need to know about configuring Monitor Points, including address formats, data types, scaling options, and advanced features. Whether you're setting up a simple temperature sensor or complex multi-register data structures, understanding these configuration options is essential for effective Modbus communication.

### Detailed Field Descriptions

#### 1. Name Field - Enhanced with Magic Codes

The Name field supports special **Magic Key Codes** to enhance functionality:

##### String Length Control
```
Format: :xx
Usage: Water Temperature:16
Effect: Reads 16 continuous registers as string
```

##### Poll Rate Control  
```
Format: @xxxx (milliseconds)
Usage: Model Name@1000
Effect: Polls every 1000ms (1 second)
Special: @-1 = Poll once at start, @0 = Skip during polling
```

##### Bit Field Access
```
Format: .n (bit index 0-15)
Usage: Status Register.8  
Effect: Extracts bit 8 from 16-bit register
```

##### Date/Time Formats

**DATETIME Display Format** - To display Date Time values with Magic Codes, you need to add a Magic Code to the Name field and set the Data Type to **DATETIME**. The processor uses the code (DOS, EPOCH, DT3, DT4, etc.) in the Name field to properly request the number of registers required for this display format to decode and display time properly.

!!! note "No Modbus Standard for DateTime"
    There is no official Modbus standard for date time representation, so analyze the manufacturer's documentation to determine the number of registers required to fetch date and time. Then, simply choose the correct Magic Code from the table below. Use **Swap Type** settings to match the remote device's byte order.

**DateTime Magic Codes:**

| Magic Code | Registers | Register Layout | Description |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **DOS** | 2 | `[YYMMDD]` `[hhmmss]` | DOS Time Stamp Y1980, 2 Registers |

=== "EPOCH Formats"

    **Unix Timestamp Formats**
    
    **EPOCH (2 Registers):**
    ```
    Usage: Unix_Time_EPOCH + Data Type = DATETIME
    Registers: 2 (32-bit timestamp)
    ```
    
    **EPOCHMS (4 Registers):**
    ```
    Usage: Unix_TimeMS_EPOCHMS + Data Type = DATETIME
    Registers: 4 (64-bit timestamp in milliseconds)
    ```

**Implementation Examples:**

!!! example "DateTime Configuration Examples"

    **Samsung Battery System:**
    ```
    Name: BMS_RTC_DT3
    Address: 400001
    Data Type: DATETIME
    Registers Used: 3 (400001, 400002, 400003)
    ```
    
    **PLC with DOS Format:**
    ```
    Name: System_Clock_DOS
    Address: 400010
    Data Type: DATETIME
    Registers Used: 2 (400010, 400011)
    ```
    
    **Industrial Controller with Full DateTime:**
    ```
    Name: Controller_Time_DT6
    Address: 300001
    Data Type: DATETIME
    Registers Used: 6 (300001-300006)
    ```

**Important Notes:**

- Always set **Data Type = DATETIME** when using DateTime Magic Codes
- Use **Swap Type** settings to match device byte order (ABCD_BE, CDBA_LE, etc.)
- Consult manufacturer documentation for register layout and byte ordering
- Test with known timestamps to verify correct interpretation
- Some devices may use zero-based or one-based addressing - adjust accordingly

##### Multiple Magic Codes
```
Example: System_Status@-1:31.5
Effect: Poll once (@-1), 32 registers (:31), bit 5 (.5)
```

#### 2. Address Field - 6-Digit Format

!!! info "Complete 6-Digit Addressing Guide"
    **For comprehensive explanations, troubleshooting, and examples:** See the [**6-Digit Addressing Scheme Guide**](../../guides/6-digit-addressing.md)
    
    This section provides XPF-specific details. The comprehensive guide covers all aspects including common mistakes, device compatibility, and conversion from other tools.

The **6-digit addressing format** provides an explicit and standardized way to identify both the register type and its address in a single number. This format is used in XPF and many other Modbus tools to simplify configuration.

**Format Structure:**

```
[Type Prefix Digit] [5-Digit Register Address]
```

**Example: 400001 breaks down as:**
- **4** = Register Type Indicator (Holding Register)
- **00001** = Register Number (1)

!!! warning "Critical: Prefix Digit ≠ Function Code"
    **Important:** The first digit is a **register type indicator**, not the Modbus function code itself (though they're related). 
    
    - **Type Prefix** → Tells you what kind of register (Coil, Discrete Input, Input Register, Holding Register)
    - **Function Code** → The actual Modbus command used to read/write that register type
    
    For example, address `400001` uses type prefix `4` (Holding Register), which is typically accessed using **Function Code 03** (Read) or **06/16** (Write).

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Prefix | Register Type | Function Codes | Address Range | Access |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **0** | Coils | FC01 (Read) / FC05, FC15 (Write) | 000001–065536 | Read/Write |
| **1** | Discrete Inputs | FC02 (Read) | 100001–165536 | Read Only |
| **3** | Input Registers | FC04 (Read) | 300001–365536 | Read Only |
| **4** | Holding Registers | FC03 (Read) / FC06, FC16 (Write) | 400001–465536 | Read/Write |

**Visual Breakdown:**

    style FC fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#388e3c,stroke-width:2px
    style ZERO fill:#ffebee,stroke:#c62828,stroke-width:2px
```

**Key Concepts:**

- **First digit (0, 1, 3, or 4)**: Indicates **register type** (not function code directly)
- **Last five digits (00000–65535)**: The **actual register address**
- **Zero-based vs One-based**: Devices may start counting from 0 or 1
  - **Zero-based:** First register = 0 (e.g., `400000`)
  - **One-based:** First register = 1 (e.g., `400001`)

!!! example "Address Examples - Understanding the Format"
    
    **Complete breakdown showing all components:**
    
    | 6-Digit Address | Type Prefix | Register # | Function Code | Physical Location | Zero-Based |
    |-----------------|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
    | `400001` | 4 (Holding) | 1 | FC03 (Read) | First holding register | 0 |
    | `400123` | 4 (Holding) | 123 | FC03 (Read) | 123rd holding register | 122 |
    | `300005` | 3 (Input) | 5 | FC04 (Read) | 5th input register | 4 |
    | `000013` | 0 (Coil) | 13 | FC01 (Read) | 13th coil | 12 |
    | `100008` | 1 (Discrete) | 8 | FC02 (Read) | 8th discrete input | 7 |

!!! tip "Converting from Other Modbus Tools"
    **If you're used to entering "Function Code + Address" separately (like Modbus Poll):**
    
    | Your Tool Shows | XPF 6-Digit Format | Conversion |
    |-----------------|-------------------|------------|
    | FC03, Address 123 | `400123` | Prefix `4` + `00123` |
    | FC04, Address 5 | `300005` | Prefix `3` + `00005` |
    | FC01, Address 13 | `000013` | Prefix `0` + `00013` |
    | FC02, Address 8 | `100008` | Prefix `1` + `00008` |
    
    **Quick Reference:**
    - **FC01/05/15** (Coils) → Prefix **0**
    - **FC02** (Discrete Inputs) → Prefix **1**  
    - **FC03/06/16** (Holding Registers) → Prefix **4**
    - **FC04** (Input Registers) → Prefix **3**

**Special Function Codes (Do NOT Use 6-Digit Address Format):**

| Function Code | Hex | Description | Use Case |
|---------------|-----|-------------|----------|
| **FC07** | 0x07 | Read Exception Status | Device error/status flags |
| **FC08** | 0x08 | Diagnostics | Device diagnostic tests (requires Sub-Function) |
| **FC11** | 0x0B | Get Comm Event Counter | Communication event counter |
| **FC12** | 0x0C | Get Comm Event Log | Communication event log retrieval |
| **FC17** | 0x11 | Report Server ID | Server/slave identification |
| **FC43** | 0x2B | Encapsulated Interface Transport | MEI - Device ID, date/time sync |
| **FC43-14** | 0x2B-0x0E | Read Device Identification | Manufacturer, model, serial strings (requires Device ID & Object ID) |
| **FC43-15** | 0x2B-0x0F | Read Date and Time | Clock read |
| **FC43-16** | 0x2B-0x10 | Write Date and Time | Clock synchronization |

!!! info "Why No 6-Digit Format for Special Functions?"
    Special function codes (FC07, FC08, FC11, FC12, FC17, FC43) don't follow the 6-digit addressing scheme because they:
    
    - Operate on device-level data (not specific registers)
    - Use different request/response structures
    - Require additional parameters (Sub-Function, Object ID, Device ID)
    - Are configured through the **Modbus Wizard** with specialized fields

!!! tip "Choosing Address Mode: Zero-Based vs One-Based"
    **Most devices use 1-based addressing** (addresses start at 1), but some use 0-based (addresses start at 0). 
    
    - Check your device documentation for its addressing convention
    - Use the **Offset** button in the List Group to switch between modes globally
    - `400001` (1-based) and `400000` (0-based) both refer to the first physical holding register

#### 3. Unit ID (Slave/Station ID)

The Unit ID identifies which Modbus slave device to communicate with on the network:

| Range | Description | Common Usage |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **1-247** | Valid Slave IDs | Standard Modbus device addressing |
| **0** | Broadcast address | Not recommended for normal operations |
| **248-255** | Reserved | Not used in standard Modbus |

**Key Points:**
- Each device on a Modbus network must have a unique Unit ID
- Use the **Swap ID** button in List Group to change all monitor points at once
- TCP/IP devices often use Unit ID 1 or match their IP last octet

#### 4. Gain (Scaling Multiplier)

Apply linear scaling to raw Modbus values using the formula: **`Y = (Gain * X) + Offset`**

| Value | Effect | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **1.0** | No scaling (default) | Raw value displayed as-is |
| **0.1** | Divide by 10 | Convert tenths to units (e.g., 235 → 23.5) |
| **10** | Multiply by 10 | Amplify small values |
| **-1** | Invert sign | Convert positive to negative |

**Common Applications:**
- Temperature conversion: Gain = 0.1 (tenths of degree to degrees)
- Pressure scaling: Gain = 0.01 (convert to proper decimal places)
- Current measurement: Gain = 0.001 (milliamps to amps)

#### 5. Offset (Value Adjustment)

Add or subtract a constant from the scaled value: **`Y = (Gain * X) + Offset`**

| Value | Effect | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **0** | No offset (default) | Scaled value used as-is |
| **-273.15** | Celsius to Kelvin | Temperature conversion |
| **32** | Celsius to Fahrenheit | After gain of 1.8 |

**Processing Order:** Raw Value → Gain (multiply) → Offset (add) → Display

#### 6. Data Type (Data Interpretation)

Defines how to interpret the raw Modbus register data.

**Available Data Types:**

| Type | Size | Range | Usage |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| **BIT** | 1 bit | 0/1 | Boolean values |
| **INT16** | 16-bit | -32,768 to 32,767 | Signed integers |
| **UINT16** | 16-bit | 0 to 65,535 | Unsigned integers (default) |
| **INT32** | 32-bit | +/- 2.1 billion | Large signed numbers |
| **UINT32** | 32-bit | 0 to 4.2 billion | Large unsigned numbers |
| **FLOAT32** | 32-bit | IEEE 754 | Floating point numbers |
| **INT64** | 64-bit | +/- 9.2 x 10^18 | Very large integers |
| **UINT64** | 64-bit | 0 to 1.8 x 10^19 | Very large unsigned |
| **DOUBLE64** | 64-bit | IEEE 754 | Double precision float |
| **HEX** | Variable | Hexadecimal | Raw hex display |
| **STRING** | Variable | Text | Character strings |
| **DATETIME** | Variable | Date/Time | Formatted timestamps |

**Most Common Types:**

- **UINT16**: Unsigned 16-bit integer (0-65535) - default for most registers
- **INT16**: Signed 16-bit integer (-32768 to 32767) - for negative values
- **FLOAT32**: 32-bit floating point - for decimal precision
- **STRING**: Text data - use with `:xx` magic code for length

#### 7. Swap Type (Byte/Word Order)

Controls byte ordering for multi-register data (32-bit, 64-bit values spanning multiple registers).

**Available Swap Types:**

| Swap Type | Description | Byte Order |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **ABCD_BE** | Big-Endian (Default) | Most significant first |
| **CDBA_LE** | Little-Endian | Least significant first |
| **BADC_BEBS** | Big-Endian Byte Swap | Bytes swapped within words |
| **CDAB_LEBS** | Little-Endian Word Swap | Words swapped |

**Quick Selection Guide:**
- **ABCD_BE** (Big-Endian): Try this first for most devices
- **CDBA_LE** (Little-Endian): If ABCD shows wrong values
- **BADC_BEBS / CDAB_LEBS**: For devices with swapped byte/word order

#### 8. Value (Current/Display Value)

The Value field serves multiple purposes depending on mode and state:

| Mode | Display | Interaction |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Client Mode** | Shows latest polled value | Read-only, auto-updates during polling |
| **Server Mode** | Editable field | Click to edit, sends value to requesting clients |
| **Error State** | Empty with red border | Click cell to view error message details |
| **Evaluate Mode** | Color-coded background | Indicates pass/fail based on limits |

#### 9. Extra (...) Button

Click the **three dots (...)** button at the end of each row to access extended options:

**Available Options:**

- **Evaluate Limits**: Set High/Low thresholds with color coding
- **CustomQ**:Custom Modbus command in hexadecimal
- **Chart**:Enable charting for this monitor point to display value trends over time
- **Simulate**:Simulation mode

#### 10. CustomQ (Custom Modbus Command)

Send raw Modbus PDU commands in hexadecimal format for special function codes or manufacturer-specific commands.

**Format:** Space-separated hex bytes (PDU only, no MBAP header or CRC)

**Examples:**
```
11 04 00 6B 00 03    # Read File Record
14 0E 06 ...         # Write File Record
2B 0E 01 00          # Read Device Identification
```

**Use Cases:**

- Custom function codes not in standard Modbus
- Manufacturer-specific diagnostics
- Advanced MEI commands
- File transfer operations

#### 11. Chart (Enable Charting)

Enable time-series charting for this monitor point to visualize value trends over time. 

!!! info "Complete Chart Guide"
    For detailed chart setup, configuration, and advanced features, see the **[Charts - Data Trends Visualization](#charts---data-trends-visualization)** section below.

| State | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Checked** | Values plotted on chart in real-time, click Chart Button in Client tab to view |
| **Unchecked** | Monitor point excluded from chart (default)|

**Requirements:** Client mode must be running (polling active) for data collection

#### 12. Axis (Chart Axis Assignment)

Assign monitor point to specific chart axis for multi-scale visualization: 

| Value | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **0** | Left axis | Temperature (0-100°C) |
| **1** | Right axis | Pressure (0-1000 PSI) |

**Benefits of Dual Axis:**

- Compare values with different scales simultaneously
- Temperature and pressure on same chart
- Speed and current measurements together

!!! info "Chart Axis Configuration"
    For complete dual-axis setup and multi-signal charting examples, see the **[Charts - Data Trends Visualization](#charts---data-trends-visualization)** section below.

#### 13. Simulate (Simulation Mode)

Enable simulation mode to generate test values without requiring an actual Modbus device.

| State | Mode | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Checked** | Simulation ON | Generates test patterns (ramp, sine, random) |
| **Unchecked** | Normal mode | Uses actual device communication |

**Available Only In:** Server mode - allows testing without physical hardware

**Simulation Patterns:**

- **Ramp**: Incrementing values for testing trending
- **Sine Wave**: Oscillating pattern for dynamic testing
- **Random**: Random values within configured range
