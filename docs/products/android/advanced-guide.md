## Introduction

The Modbus Monitor Advanced is a comprehensive **3-in-1 solution**: Modbus Client, Server, and Sensor Server in a single Android application. This professional app allows you to poll Modbus-speaking devices for data directly from your mobile device.

The Modbus Monitor Advanced operates in two primary modes: **Master (Client)** and **Slave (Server)**. The operation, configuration, and communication differ based on the selected mode. The paid version includes all features of the free app and excels in professional features, configuration options, and ease of data input.

**Master (Client) Mode**: The app polls remote devices to retrieve data, which is then displayed in your chosen data format, including raw data.

**Slave (Server) Mode**: Your phone or tablet acts as a Modbus TCP Slave Device, allowing other devices on the network to poll your device for data.

The advantage of the Modbus Monitor Advanced is that it combines both modes in one application, eliminating the need to purchase separate apps.

**Essential App Features**:

- **⚙️ Settings** - Configure protocols, timing, and cloud integrations  
- **📤 Export/Import** - CSV data management and email sharing

## Getting Started

### Main Interface Overview

The Modbus Monitor Advanced features an intuitive main interface designed for both novice and expert users. Understanding this interface is crucial for effective operation, as it serves as your command center for all Modbus communication activities.

**Interface Design Philosophy**:
The main screen combines **status indicators** with **action buttons** for streamlined operation. Each visual element serves a specific purpose - status lights show what's happening, buttons control operations, and data displays provide real-time feedback. This unified design eliminates the need to navigate between multiple screens during normal operation.

**For New Users**: Don't be overwhelmed by the interface - you'll primarily use just a few key elements:

- The **+ button [10]** to add new connections
- **Monitor Points [9]** to view your data
- **Client Mode [3]** to start/stop data collection

**For Advanced Users**: The interface provides comprehensive control over multiple simultaneous connections, with detailed statistics, server capabilities, and extensive configuration options all accessible from this single screen.

The main interface combines status indicators with action buttons for easy operation. Each row displays monitor points showing Name, Configuration details, current Modbus values, send/receive frames, and packet response times.

## Client Mode - Polling Remote Devices

**Client Mode** transforms your Android device into a powerful **Modbus Master** that can poll multiple remote devices for live data. This is the primary mode for field engineers and technicians who need to monitor, troubleshoot, and analyze industrial systems.

**Advanced Multi-Channel Capability**: Each [Monitor Point](#monitor-points---core-concept) becomes a powerful data source with its own independent communication channel (Serial, TCP/IP, or Bluetooth). This allows you to collect data from different devices using different protocols simultaneously, enabling you to configure and monitor systems from various sources and build comprehensive system-level information from a single interface.


### Configuration Essentials

To start polling in Master Mode, Modbus Monitor Advanced requires at least one monitor point. You can add a monitor point by clicking the (+) button or selecting "Add" from the menu. When you click "Add" or (+), a monitor point is added with default settings and values.

**Monitor Points Management Dialog**: This is your central command hub for modifying, configuring, and controlling individual Modbus points (registers or coils) within your list. See the detailed [Monitor Points Management](#monitor-point-management) section for complete information about all available options.

### Monitor Point Configuration

Monitor point configuration defines how your app connects to and interprets data from Modbus devices. Each monitor point specifies the device address, register location, data format, and polling behavior for a specific piece of data you want to monitor or control.

### Write Operations

Write operations enable bidirectional Modbus communication, allowing you to send values to remote devices (Client Mode) or populate internal registers for remote masters to read (Server Mode). This powerful feature transforms your Android device from a read-only monitor into a full-featured industrial control interface, capable of adjusting setpoints, triggering operations, and managing device configurations.

**Two Ways to Write Values:**

1. **Write Dialog** - Enter custom values through an interactive dialog for one-time changes or testing
2. **Write Preset Value** - Instantly send pre-configured values via the **[Monitor Points - Preset [9f]](#main-interface-overview)** button for quick operations

Both methods are accessible through the [Monitor Point Management](#monitor-point-management) dialog and work in Client and Server modes.

#### Modbus Write Dialog

The Write Dialog box is displayed when selecting the "Write" option from the [Monitor Point Management](#monitor-point-management) dialog (tap any monitor point to access). The dialog header shows the Monitor Point name along with the configured Data Type. Enter the value in the write field and click the Change button.

<figure markdown>
  ![Modbus Write Dialog](../../assets/screenshots/android-advanced/modbus-write.webp){ width="400" loading="lazy" }
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Write dialog for sending values to remote devices</figcaption>
</figure>


**Important**: The Write Dialog box is available in both Client and Server modes. During Client operation, the write value is included in the Modbus packet sent to the remote server using the selected Write Function. During Server operation, the write value is stored in internal registers where remote masters can poll and retrieve it via standard Modbus communication.

**Write vs. Write Preset Value**:

| Operation | Description | Access Method |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Write** | Send custom value entered in dialog | Select "Write" option from [Monitor Point Management](#monitor-point-management) dialog |
| **Write Preset Value** | Send pre-configured default value | Click **[Monitor Points - Preset [9f]](#main-interface-overview)** button or select "Write Preset Value" from management dialog |

**Write Capabilities**: 

- **Safety First**: Write operations disabled by default to prevent accidental changes
- **Dual Mode Support**: Available in both Client and Server modes
- **Custom Values**: Enter any valid value for the configured data type
- **Preset Values**: Quick access to pre-configured default values

**Mode-Specific Behavior**:

=== "Client Mode Write"

    **Direct Device Communication**:
    - Write value included in Modbus packet sent directly to remote server
    - Uses appropriate Modbus write function (05, 06, 15, or 16) based on data type
    - Immediate transmission to target device
    - Write confirmation received from remote device
    
    **Typical Use Cases**:
    - Adjusting setpoints on remote controllers
    - Changing operational parameters
    - Testing device responses
    - Emergency shutdowns or mode changes

=== "Server Mode Write"

    **Internal Register Storage**:
    - Write value stored in internal app memory/registers
    - Value becomes available for remote masters to poll
    - No immediate network transmission
    - Value persists until overwritten or app restart
    
    **Typical Use Cases**:
    - Populating server registers with test data
    - Setting default values for client polling
    - Simulating device responses
    - Creating mock data for development/testing

**Multi-Device Support**: Each monitor point supports different protocols and connections, enabling write operations across multiple devices and networks simultaneously.

**Safety and Configuration**:
- **Enable Writing**: Must be explicitly enabled per monitor point in configuration
- **Data Type Validation**: Ensures entered values match configured data type
- **Range Checking**: Validates values are within acceptable limits
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback on failed write attempts

!!! warning "Write Safety"
    Write operations are disabled by default for safety. Enable writing only for monitor points where you need to send commands or data to devices. Always verify the target device and address before enabling write operations.

!!! tip "Using Preset Values"
    Configure preset values during monitor point setup to enable quick "Write Preset Value" operations. This is especially useful for:
    
    - **Emergency stops** - Quick access to safe shutdown values
    - **Standard setpoints** - Rapid return to normal operating parameters  
    - **Test values** - Consistent test data for development and debugging
    - **Default configurations** - Reset devices to known good states

## Modbus Server Mode (Slave)

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Back to Main Interface](#main-interface-overview)

Turn your Android device into a **Modbus TCP Server** that other devices can poll for data. Your phone/tablet becomes a data source that remote Modbus masters can read and write using standard Modbus TCP protocol.

<figure markdown>
  ![Modbus Server Mode Interface](../../assets/screenshots/android-advanced/mma-server-main.webp){ width="500" loading="lazy" }
  <figcaption>Figure 4: Server mode active showing IP address, port, and connected client count</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! tip "When to Use Server Mode"
    Use Server Mode when you want **other devices to poll YOUR Android** for data. Perfect for:
    
    - **Data Publishing**: Share sensor data or calculated values with PLCs/SCADA
    - **System Integration**: Act as a gateway between different protocols/networks  
    - **Testing**: Simulate PLC/RTU responses for development
    - **Multi-Reader**: Allow several clients to access the same data simultaneously
    - **Protocol Converter**: Read data from Serial/Bluetooth devices (Client mode) and expose via Modbus TCP (Server mode) - transforms non-TCP devices into network-accessible endpoints

**Key Benefits**:

- **Multiple Clients**: Handle several remote devices at once
- **Standard Protocol**: Industry-standard Modbus TCP (no custom drivers needed)
- **Read & Write**: Clients can both read values and write updates
- **Easy Setup**: Shared configuration with Client mode
- **Gateway Capability**: Run Client + Server simultaneously to bridge protocols (e.g., Serial RTU Modbus TCP)

!!! warning "Protocol Converter Mode"
    When using Client and Server modes simultaneously as a protocol converter, ensure monitor points use compatible configurations. Only certain channel/protocol combinations are supported - test your specific setup thoroughly before final deployment.

!!! note "Protocol Limitation"
    Server mode supports **Modbus TCP only**. For multiple protocols, see [Modbus Monitor XPF](https://quantumbitsolutions.com/windows-xpf-monitor/).

| **Count** | e.g., **10** | Number of registers (5 floats = 10 words) |
| **Data Type** | **Float**, **INT16U**, etc. | How data is interpreted |

**Auto-Configured** (ignored by server):
- IP Address (uses your device IP)
- Port (uses port from Settings  Server)

!!! warning "Use 6-Digit Addressing"
    Addresses use **Modbus protocol format** (e.g., 400001 = holding register 1). See [6-Digit Addressing Guide](../../guides/6-digit-addressing.md) for help.

**Example - Serve 5 Float Values**:
```yaml
Protocol: Modbus TCP
Address: 400001   # Holding register 1
Count: 10         # 5 floats × 2 registers each
Data Type: Float
```

## Monitor Points - Core Concept

[:octicons-arrow-left-24: Back to Main Interface](#main-interface-overview)

**Monitor Points** are the fundamental building blocks of Modbus Monitor Advanced. Think of them as intelligent tags (similar to PLC tags) that completely define how to communicate with a specific piece of data on a Modbus device.

<figure markdown id="figure-9">
![Monitor Points List](../../assets/screenshots/android-advanced/mma-main-ui.webp){ loading="lazy" }
<figcaption>Figure 9: Main interface highlighting Monitor Points [9] - the data display area showing live values from multiple devices</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note "Figure Reference"
    Figure 9 shows the same main interface as [Figure 1](#figure-1), but specifically highlights the **Monitor Points [9]** section where all your configured data points are displayed with live values, configuration details, and communication status.

### What is a Monitor Point?

Each monitor point is a **complete configuration package** containing everything needed to:

- **Communicate** - Protocol, IP address, port, channel selection (TCP/IP, Serial, Bluetooth)
- **Locate Data** - Modbus address, register count, slave ID, function codes
- **Display Values** - Data type interpretation, scaling, engineering units
- **Control Devices** - Write values, preset commands, safety settings
- **Transform Data** - Mathematical operations, coded messages, sensor integration

!!! tip "The Power of Monitor Points"
    **Multi-Device SCADA Capability**: Each monitor point can use **completely different** protocols, IP addresses, ports, and channels. This means you can simultaneously monitor:
    
    - A PLC via Modbus TCP on one channel
    - A sensor via Serial RTU on another channel  
    - A controller via Bluetooth on a third channel
    
    All from a **single unified interface** - true SCADA-level data collection on your mobile device!

### Building Your Monitor Point List

**Three Ways to Add Monitor Points**:

| Method | Best For | How To |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Manual Entry** | Individual points, learning | Tap **(+)** button on main screen |
| **Copy & Paste** | Similar configurations | Use [Monitor Point Management](#monitor-point-management) dialog |
| **CSV Import** | Bulk deployment (hundreds/thousands) | [Hamburger Menu](#hamburger-menu)  Import |

**CSV Import Benefits**: Load pre-configured monitor point lists from email attachments or the Downloads folder - perfect for deploying standardized configurations across multiple devices or sites.

### Monitor Point Management

**The Monitor Point Management Dialog** is your central control hub for managing individual monitor points. This dialog provides quick access to all configuration, modification, and control operations for the selected monitor point.

#### How to Open the Management Dialog

<figure markdown>
  ![Accessing Monitor Points Management Dialog](../../assets/screenshots/android-advanced/mma-monitor-points-mangement.webp){ loading="lazy" }
  <figcaption>Figure 11: Two ways to access - tap any monitor point directly or swipe left to reveal menu</figcaption>
</figure>

**Quick Access Methods**:

1. **Direct Tap**: Touch any monitor point in the main list [9](#figure-1)
2. **Swipe Left**: Swipe left on a monitor point to expose the menu button, then tap it

The dialog appears immediately, displaying all available management options as radio buttons.

#### Available Management Options

| Option | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Communications** | Toggle communication on/off for this point | Temporarily pause polling without deleting the configuration |

**Simple 3-Step Process**:

1. **Select**: Tap the radio button next to your desired action
2. **Execute**: Press **OK** to perform the action
3. **Cancel**: Press **Cancel** to exit without changes

!!! tip "Quick Configuration Workflow"
    - **First Time Setup**: Use **Change** to configure all settings
    - **Duplicate Points**: Use **Copy** → **Paste** → **Change** to modify specifics
    - **Ongoing Use**: Use **Write** or **Write Preset Value** for value changes

#### Key Features & Capabilities

**Smart Interface Adaptation**

The configuration dialog automatically adapts its view based on complexity:

- **Simple View**: Shows only essential settings for basic monitor points
- **Advanced View**: Expands to show all options when complex features are configured (Math, Coded Messages, Sensor Server)

**Bulk Operations**

The **"Apply Settings to All"** option propagates communication settings from the selected point to all other monitor points in your list:

- **What Gets Copied**: Channel, Protocol, IP Address, Port, Connection settings
- **What Stays Unique**: Name, Address, Slave ID, Data Type, Count
- **Warning**: This affects ALL monitor points - use carefully in multi-device scenarios

#### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Error notifications** (e.g., "Error 343235") | Configuration invalid or driver busy | Wait a few seconds and retry the operation |
| **Write commands fail** | Write capability not enabled | Use **Change** → [Modbus Configuration](#modbus-configuration) → Enable write function |
| **Write to Input Registers fails** | Register type is read-only | Verify you're writing to Holding Registers (400001+), not Input Registers (300001+) |
| **Paste doesn't work** | No configuration in clipboard | Select a point and use **Copy** first |
| **Apply Settings to All affects wrong points** | Applied to all without distinction | Manually configure each point, or group similar devices and apply selectively |

!!! tip "Best Practices for Monitor Point Management"
    **Configuration Safety**:
    
    - Always **Copy** important configurations before making major changes
    - Test write operations on non-critical devices first
    - Use descriptive names that identify device, location, and data type
    
    **Efficiency Tips**:
    
    - Configure one point completely, then **Copy** → **Paste** → **Change** specific fields for similar devices
    - Group related monitor points together in the list for easier management
    - Use **Hide/Unhide Configuration** to reduce screen clutter once points are configured
    
    **Write Operations**:
    
    - Both **Write** and **Write Preset Value** work in Client Mode (sends to remote device) and Server Mode (stores in internal registers)
    - Configure preset values for frequently used settings (emergency stops, default setpoints)
    - See [Write Operations](#write-operations) for complete write functionality details

## Sensor Server Mode

**Sensor Server** is an innovative extension of the Modbus Server that exposes your Android device's built-in sensors through the Modbus TCP protocol.

!!! tip "Configuration Details"
    For detailed sensor selection and configuration options, see the [Sensor Server Configuration](#sensor-server-configuration) section in the Monitor Point Configuration guide.

### What is Sensor Server?

#### Core Concept

- **Hardware Integration**: Links Android sensors directly to Modbus registers  
- **No Programming Required**: Any Modbus TCP Master can access phone sensors
- **Automatic Configuration**: Sensor selection automatically configures register settings
- **Real-time Data**: Live sensor readings available via standard Modbus polling


#### Available Sensors

**Common Android Sensors**:

- **Accelerometer**: Device motion and orientation
- **Gyroscope**: Angular velocity measurements  
- **Light Sensor**: Ambient light levels
- **Orientation**: Device position in 3D space
- **Temperature**: Ambient temperature (device-dependent)
- **Barometer**: Atmospheric pressure
- **Magnetometer**: Magnetic field strength
- **Proximity**: Object detection near device

<figcaption>Figure 8: Accelerometer configured in Server Mode showing real-time values accessible to remote Modbus TCP clients</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Quick Setup (5 Steps)

1. **Enable Server Mode** - Turn on Modbus Server in [Settings → Server](#settings)
2. **Add Monitor Point** - Tap **(+)** button on main screen
3. **Select Sensor** - Choose sensor from dropdown (e.g., Accelerometer)
4. **Verify Auto-Config** - App automatically sets all Modbus parameters
5. **Start Server** - Tap **[Server Mode icon [2]](#figure-1)** to begin

!!! success "Automatic Configuration"
    When you select a sensor, the app automatically configures:
    
    - **Protocol**: Modbus TCP
    - **Data Type**: Float (32-bit IEEE 754)
    - **Count**: 6 registers (3 float values × 2 registers each)
    - **Register Name**: Live sensor specifications and readings

#### Understanding Sensor Data Format

**Scalar Array Structure**: Sensor values are exposed as arrays in consecutive Modbus registers.

**Example - Accelerometer Reading**:

| Array Index | Axis | Value | Register Address | Purpose |
|-------------|------|-------|------------------|---------|
| **[0]** -0.031 | X | -0.031 m/s² | 400001-400002 | Lateral motion (left/right) |
| **[1]** 8.272 | Y | 8.272 m/s² | 400003-400004 | Longitudinal motion (forward/back) |
| **[2]** 5.102 | Z | 5.102 m/s² | 400005-400006 | Vertical motion (up/down) |

!!! info "Key Points"
    - Each **float value** occupies **2 consecutive registers** (32-bit format)
    - Remote clients read starting at the **configured address** (e.g., 400001)
    - Number of array elements **varies by sensor type** (1-axis to 3-axis)
    - Readings update in **real-time** as sensor values change

#### Sensor Information Display

The register name field shows comprehensive sensor specifications automatically:

```
Sensor #[ID] [SensorName]
Power:[mA] Resolution:[value] Range:[max]
Vendor:[manufacturer] Version:[number]
Raw Data: [0]xxx.xx [1]xxx.xx [2]xxx.xx
```

**What Each Field Means**:

- **Sensor ID**: Android system identifier
- **Power**: Current consumption (mA)
- **Resolution**: Measurement precision
- **Range**: Maximum measurable value
- **Vendor**: Hardware manufacturer
- **Version**: Sensor driver version
- **Raw Data**: Live readings updated in real-time

#### Configuration Requirements

**Minimum Settings** (auto-configured when sensor selected):

| Setting | Required Value | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Sensor Selection** | Choose from the List | Varies by device hardware |
| **Address** | 6-digit format (e.g., 400001) | Starting register for data |
| **Count** | 6 minimum | 3 floats × 2 registers each |
| **Protocol** | Modbus TCP | Server mode requirement |
| **Data Type** | Float | 32-bit IEEE 754 format |

!!! tip "Device-Specific Sensors"
    Available sensors depend on your device hardware. Common sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Light, Barometer, Temperature, Proximity. Check your device specifications for exact sensor list.

### Common Use Cases

## Practical Guides

Now that you understand the interface, settings, and monitor point configuration details, this section provides step-by-step guides for the two main active modes: Client (Master) and Server (Slave). For publishing Android sensors, see the consolidated [Sensor Server Mode](#sensor-server-mode) section above.

### Guide 1: Using Modbus Client Mode (Master)

**What is Client Mode?** In Client (Master) Mode, your Android device polls remote Modbus devices (servers/slaves) to retrieve data and optionally write values back to them. This is the most common use case for monitoring PLCs, sensors, meters, and other industrial equipment. In this guide we configure three monitoring points—each on a different channel (1. TCP/IP, 2. USB Serial, 3. Bluetooth BLE using an HM‑10 module)—to demonstrate simultaneous multi‑channel communication.

<figure markdown>

   - Icon turns **green** (chain link) when active
3. Your monitor point now shows live data values

**Expected Results**:

- **Numbers displayed**: Successfully reading from device
- **"?????" displayed**: Communication failure - check settings
- **Packet counters**: Good/Bad counters show communication health

#### Writing Values to Remote Devices

Once your monitor point is configured and reading successfully, you can write values back to the device:

**Enable Write Capability**:

1. Tap monitor point **"Change"**
2. Expand **[Modbus Configuration](#modbus-configuration)**  scroll to Write Operations tab
3. **Write Function**: Select appropriate function (already set in during Modbus Monitoring Configuration)
   - `Write Single Coil (05)` for boolean values
   - `Write Single Register (06)` for single registers
   - `Write Multiple Registers (16)` for multiple registers
4. **(Optional) Button Write Value**: Set a preset value for quick writes
5. Tap **OK** to save

**Two Ways to Write**:

1. **Custom Value Write**:
   - Tap monitor point **"Write"**
   - Enter value in dialog
   - Tap **"Change"** to send
   
2. **Preset Value Write** (faster):
   - Tap monitor point **"Write Preset Value"**
   - Instantly sends pre-configured value

!!! warning "Write Safety"
    Write operations are **disabled by default** to prevent accidents. Always test writes on non-critical systems first.

For complete write operation details, see the [Write Operations](#write-operations) section.

#### Advanced Client Mode Features

**Multiple Device Monitoring**: Add multiple monitor points with different IP addresses, ports, protocols, and channels. Each point operates independently.

**Polling Optimization**:

- **Interval**: Set in [Settings  Timing](#settings) (default: 1000ms)
- **Timeout**: Adjust if devices are slow to respond
- **Retries**: Configure retry attempts for failed communications

**Data Scaling and Transformation**:

- Use **[Math  Linear Transformation](#math-configuration)** to scale raw values
- Apply **[Coded Messages](#coded-messages-configuration)** to translate numbers to text

**Cloud Integration**: Enable real-time data logging to Google Sheets, ThingSpeak, or MQTT brokers (requires add-ons). Data is sent to the cloud after each complete monitoring loop through all configured points.

#### Troubleshooting Client Mode

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"?????" values** | Check IP address, port, slave ID, and network connectivity |
| **Timeouts** | Increase timeout in Settings  Timing, verify device is online |
| **Wrong values** | Verify address format (6-digit), data type, and byte order |
| **No USB device** | Check USB-OTG support, adapter compatibility, USB permissions |
| **Write failures** | Ensure write capability is enabled, correct write function selected |

### Guide 2: Modbus Server Mode (Slave)

**Goal**: Make your Android device readable by other Modbus TCP masters in under 5 minutes.

**Server Mode Basics**: Your device answers Modbus TCP requests. Remote systems poll the register values you expose (and can write if enabled). Full theory is in the earlier [Modbus Server Mode](#modbus-server-mode-slave) section—this guide is the fast, beginner walkthrough.

#### 1. When to Use
| Use Case | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Testing | Simulate a Modbus device for SCADA / PLC validation |
| Sensor Publishing | Share phone sensor data (see [Sensor Server Mode](#sensor-server-mode)) |
| Protocol Bridge | Combine Client + Server to relay serial/Bluetooth data as TCP |
| Demo / Training | Provide live registers for classroom or lab exercises |

#### 2. Minimum Requirements
- Wi‑Fi/Ethernet connection
- One monitor point (at least) with Protocol = Modbus TCP
- Open port (use `8888` if `502` blocked/non‑root)

#### 3. Quick Start (Essential Steps)
1. Menu → Settings → Server → Enable “Modbus Server?” (icon [2] appears)
2. Set Port: `8888` (safe default). Leave Auto Start off for now.
3. Tap (+) to add a monitor point → tap it → Change.
4. Channel: TCP/IP | Protocol: Modbus TCP.
5. Address: `400001` | Count: `2` (example float) | Data Type: FLOAT32 | Slave ID: `1`.
6. OK → Tap Server icon [2] → Icon turns green → Note IP & Port.
7. Test from a PC Modbus client reading 400001 Count=2 (should return a value or 0 if not written yet).

#### 4. Minimal Configuration Reference
| Field | Example | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Port | 8888 | Accessible without root; avoids common conflicts |
| Channel | TCP/IP | Required for Server Mode |
| Protocol | Modbus TCP | Only protocol served |
| Address | 400001 | First holding register (6‑digit format) |
| Count | 2 | Size for one 32‑bit float (2 × 16‑bit registers) |
| Data Type | FLOAT32 | Defines value interpretation |
| Slave ID | 1 | Unit ID some clients still send |
| Write Function | Read Only (start) | Prevent accidental writes |

#### 5. Example Register Map (Small Demo)
| Point | Name | Address | Count | Data Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | TankLevel | 400001 | 2 | FLOAT32 | Simulated level value |
| 2 | MotorSpeed | 400003 | 2 | FLOAT32 | Simulated RPM |
| 3 | StatusFlag | 400005 | 1 | INT16U | Bit/flag status |

Spacing keeps floats aligned (each float = 2 registers). Adjust addresses as needed; they must not overlap.

#### 6. Writing Data (Optional)
To serve a non‑zero value: tap monitor point → Write → enter value → Change. Or set a preset: Change → Write Operations tab → Button Write Value → OK → Use “Write Preset Value”. Remote clients then read updated registers.

#### 7. Testing From a PC
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Open QModMaster / ModScan / pymodbus script |
| 2 | Enter IP (shown near Server icon) & Port (e.g., 8888) |
| 3 | Function: Read Holding Registers (FC3) |
| 4 | Start Address: 400001 | Quantity: 2 |
| 5 | Confirm value (0 or written float). Write test value and re‑read. |

If Address field requires “raw” number, subtract 400000 (e.g., 1) depending on client addressing style.

#### 8. Optional Enhancements
- Enable Auto Start for dedicated gateways.
- Add Sensor Server monitor points for live accelerometer data.
- Use Copy/Paste to bulk duplicate similar registers.
- Pre‑populate values with Preset for predictable startup diagnostics.

#### 9. Troubleshooting (Fast Table)

For detailed error code explanations and solutions, see the [:octicons-alert-circle: Error Codes & Troubleshooting Guide](../../guides/error-codes.md).
| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Client timeout | Wrong IP/Port or firewall | Verify IP; try port 8888; check router rules |
| Reads always 0 | No write performed / wrong address | Write a test value; confirm address matches 6‑digit format |
| Client shows illegal function | Using non‑TCP protocol | Ensure monitor point Protocol = Modbus TCP |
| Value length mismatch | Count incorrect | Set Count=2 for 32‑bit float, 1 for INT16 |
| Cannot use port 502 | Non‑root Android restriction | Use 8888 or any >1024 |
| Writes ignored | Write Function set to Read Only | Change Write Function, then retry |
| Random disconnects | Power saving / sleep | Disable Battery Saver or keep device awake |

#### 10. Safety & Good Practice
| Tip | Reason |
|-----|--------|
| Start Read Only | Prevent unintended device control |
| Document register map | Helps remote users avoid overlap/misuse |
| Separate test vs production ports | Avoid accidental polling on live systems |
| Avoid exposing sensitive data | No authentication built‑in; stay on trusted networks |

**Step 4: Populate Registers with Data**

Server mode stores data in internal memory. You have two options:

=== "Option 1: Manual Write"

    1. Tap monitor point **"Write"**
    2. Enter value
    3. Tap **"Change"** to store in register
    4. Value is now available for remote clients to read

=== "Option 2: Preset Values"

    1. Tap monitor point **"Change"**
    2. In Modbus Configuration  Write Operations tab
    3. Set **"Button Write Value"** to your default value
    4. Tap **OK** to save
    5. Tap monitor point **"Write Preset Value"** to load default

**Step 5: Start the Server**

1. Tap the **[Server Mode icon [2]](#figure-1)**
2. Icon turns **green** when server is running
3. Main screen shows **Server IP Address and Port**
4. Remote clients can now connect and poll your device

**Verify Server is Running**:

- Server icon is **green**
- IP address and port displayed on main screen
- Use another Modbus client to test connection

#### Understanding Server Data Flow

1. **Configuration**: You set up monitor points with addresses and data types
2. **Data Storage**: Values are written to internal memory at specified addresses
3. **Client Request**: Remote master sends Modbus read request
4. **Response**: App retrieves value from memory and responds to client
5. **Write Support**: Clients can also write values to your server (if enabled)

For detailed explanation, see [How Server Mode Works](#how-server-mode-works).

#### Testing Your Server

**Use Another Modbus Client to Test**:

1. On a computer on the same network, use Modbus client software
2. Connect to your Android device's IP address and configured port
3. Read the register addresses you configured
4. You should see the values you wrote

**Common Test Tools**:

- **Modbus Monitor XPF** (Windows)
- **QModMaster** (Cross-platform)
- **ModScan** (Windows)
- **Python modbus-tk or pymodbus** (Programming)

#### Server Mode Best Practices

**Register Organization**:

- Use logical address ranges for different data types
- Document your register map for remote clients
- Reserve address ranges for future expansion

**Performance Optimization**:

- Don't create more monitor points than you need
- Group related data in consecutive registers
- Set appropriate polling intervals for your application

**Security Considerations**:

- Server has no authentication - use on trusted networks only
- Consider firewall rules to restrict access
- Use non-standard ports for additional obscurity
- Monitor connection activity

#### Troubleshooting Server Mode

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Can't connect to server** | Verify IP address, check firewall settings, ensure server is started |
| **Port already in use** | Change to different port in Settings, check for other apps using port |
| **Clients read wrong values** | Verify address format matches client expectations, check data type |
| **Write operations fail** | Enable write capability in monitor point configuration |
| **Server stops unexpectedly** | Check Android battery optimization settings, disable power saving |

## Add-Ons Integration

Modbus Monitor Advanced can be extended with cloud integration add-ons that enable real-time data logging, IoT dashboards, and remote monitoring capabilities. This section covers the three available add-ons.

!!! info "Add-On Purchase Required"
    The following features require separate add-on purchases from the app or [quantumbitsolutions.com](https://quantumbitsolutions.com/purchase/). Configuration options appear in Settings after purchase.

### Cloud Publishing FAQ

Use these FAQs to understand how locally collected data (Bluetooth, Serial, TCP/IP) is forwarded to remote cloud services (MQTT, Google Sheets, ThingSpeak).

??? question "How does local data reach the cloud?"
    After each complete polling cycle (Client Mode) or after internal register updates (Server/Sensor Server), the app aggregates current monitor point values and triggers publishing routines for any enabled add-ons. Each add-on uses its own transport (HTTPS for Sheets/ThingSpeak, MQTT protocol for brokers).

??? question "Do Bluetooth and Serial data publish the same as TCP/IP data?"
    Yes. Channel type is abstracted at the monitor point layer. Once a value is updated (Bluetooth, Serial RTU/ASCII, TCP/IP), it is treated uniformly for cloud publishing. Failed reads (displayed as `?????`) are skipped or sent as blank (configurable in future versions).

??? question "What is a good update interval for cloud publishing?"
    Recommended polling interval: 1000–3000 ms for stable industrial devices. For Google Sheets use ≥5 s to avoid quota pressure; ThingSpeak free tier enforces 15 s minimum per channel; MQTT can handle high frequency but practical field deployments usually stay at 1–2 s unless streaming fast-changing data.

??? question "How are Google Sheets columns mapped?"
    Each monitor point becomes a row append or a column update depending on configuration (planned enhancement). Present implementation appends a timestamp plus sequential monitor point values in fixed order. Name and Units help downstream identification—use descriptive Names.

??? question "How do I handle ThingSpeak's 8-field limit?"
    Select up to 8 critical monitor points or aggregate related values into scaled/combined fields using Math Configuration. Create multiple channels if you need >8 distinct values; document mapping externally for traceability.

??? question "What MQTT topic structure should I use?"
    Suggested pattern:
    ```
    modbus/<deviceId>/<pointName>/<address>
    ```
    Example: `modbus/android01/TankLevel/400001`. For grouped payloads publish JSON on `modbus/<deviceId>/batch` containing an array of `{name,address,value,units,timestamp}` objects. Use QoS 1 for reliability; QoS 0 for fastest throughput; retain only configuration topics, not live telemetry.
    
        Example batch JSON payload:
        ```json
        {
            "deviceId": "android01",
            "timestamp": "2025-11-25T14:03:00Z",
            "points": [
                {"name": "TankLevel", "address": 400001, "value": 73.42, "units": "%"},
                {"name": "MotorSpeed", "address": 400003, "value": 1450, "units": "RPM"},
                {"name": "AccelX", "address": 400101, "value": -0.031, "units": "m/s²"}
            ]
        }
        ```

??? question "Can I publish Sensor Server values to MQTT?"
    Yes—sensor-backed monitor points are just float values in registers. Once enabled, their current array elements are published like any other point. Consider a prefix `sensor/` or an additional attribute in JSON payload for differentiation.

??? question "What happens if the network drops?"
    MQTT: Messages fail and are retried automatically if the session can reconnect; offline periods lose non-retained telemetry.
    Google Sheets / ThingSpeak: HTTP post fails silently; data is not cached for replay. For critical reliability consider an external buffering gateway or future app buffering feature.

??? question "Security considerations?"
    - Use TLS-enabled MQTT brokers (port 8883) where possible.
    - Avoid publishing sensitive data to public ThingSpeak channels.
    - Limit Google Sheets sharing permissions; treat spreadsheet URL as semi-sensitive.
    - Keep Android device on trusted Wi‑Fi; avoid open networks for write-enabled points.

??? question "How do I reduce data usage?"
    Increase polling interval, publish only changing values (future delta mode), aggregate multiple points into a single MQTT JSON payload, and disable unused add-ons. Use Math/Scaling to condense data (e.g., packing status bits into one INT16 field).

??? question "Troubleshooting: No data appears in cloud?"
    | Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
    |---------|-------------|--------|
    | Empty rows in Google Sheets | Spreadsheet ID or auth missing | Re-enter credentials; verify sheet exists |
    | ThingSpeak update refused | Interval below 15 s limit | Increase delay to ≥15 s; check API key |
    | MQTT broker disconnects | Wrong host/port or TLS mismatch | Verify broker settings; test with an external MQTT client |
    | Values are `?????` locally | Communication failure upstream | Fix channel/protocol config; publishing skips invalid values |
    | High data costs | Polling interval too low | Raise interval; batch MQTT messages |

??? question "Choosing between MQTT, ThingSpeak, Google Sheets?"
    | Need | Best Choice | Why |
    |------|------------|-----|
    | Real-time streaming & integration | MQTT | Low latency, flexible topics, enterprise brokers |
    | Simple dashboard + public sharing | ThingSpeak | Built-in charts, MATLAB analytics, easy API |
    | Spreadsheet logging & reporting | Google Sheets | Familiar interface, export to CSV/Excel |
    | Hybrid (live + archival) | MQTT + Sheets | Stream critical data; log periodic summaries |

??? tip "Best Practice Summary"
    Poll locally at a stable interval (1–2 s), publish only required points, use descriptive names, apply scaling/units, test each add-on individually, then enable combined publishing. Document field/topic mapping for maintainability.

    **Modbus Monitor Advanced** is purpose-built for field deployment:
    
    - No laptop requiredruns on Android phone/tablet
    - Sensor integration (measure vibration, orientation, location)
    - Cloud publishing for remote team visibility
    - Bluetooth and USB-OTG for serial devices
    - Portable and rugged (use industrial Android tablets)
    
    ModScan requires Windows laptop and lacks sensor/mobile capabilities. Use Advanced for field work, ModScan only for legacy desktop workflows.

??? question "Are these tools compatible with each other?"
    Yes! All speak standard Modbus protocol:
    
    - Use **Modbus Monitor Advanced** as Server Mode; poll with QModMaster or XPF for verification
    - Run pymodbus scripts writing to devices; monitor with **Advanced** from mobile
    - Test configurations in QModMaster desktop; deploy production monitoring with **Advanced** mobile
    - Use **Advanced** Sensor Server Mode; poll with pymodbus or XPF for sensor data collection

??? question "My USB Serial Port is not working; what should I do?"
    USB-OTG connectivity requires several checks:
    
    **Prerequisites**:
    - Device must support USB-OTG (not all phones/tablets have this hardware)
    - You must use a **proper USB-OTG cable**, not a standard USB cable
    - See [:material-chip: Android Hardware Guide](../../guides/android-hardware.md) for approved cables and adapters
    
    **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    
    1. **Exit and restart the app** after plugging in USB cable. On first connection, Android selects which app has access to the serial port. The app needs a second launch to properly detect the driver.
    
    2. **Verify USB-OTG hardware support**: Test with free Android utilities:
       - **Easy OTG Checker** ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kjarvel.easyotgchecker){:target="_blank"}) - Check if your device supports USB-OTG
       - **FTDI Android App** ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ftdi.j2xx.hyperterm){:target="_blank"}) - For FTDI-type dongles
       - **Prolific Android App** - For Prolific-type serial adapters
    
    3. **Check USB cable quality**: Poor-quality USB-OTG cables are a common cause. Verify with Easy OTG Checker; if it shows "not good," the cable needs replacement.
    
    4. **Grant app permissions**: When you plug in the USB device, a permission dialog appears asking you to select which app has access. **Select "Modbus Monitor Advanced"** explicitly.
    
    5. **Verify driver compatibility**: Confirm your USB-to-serial adapter is compatible (FTDI, Prolific, or SiLab chips are most reliable).
    
    6. **Check for rooting/manufacturer restrictions**: Some manufacturers disable USB-OTG even when Android supports it. If all utilities show "good" but it still doesn't work, contact the device manufacturer.

??? question "What is a Modbus (TCP) Server?"
    A **Modbus TCP Server** is a Modbus slave device that listens for incoming TCP/IP connections and serves data to clients that request it.
    
    **Key Facts**:
    - Only protocol used is **Modbus TCP** (TCP/IP format)
    - Standard port is **502**, but that's locked on Android
    - Android requires ports **> 1024** (unless device is rooted)
    - Recommended testing port: **8888**
    - Your Modbus controller device must connect to the same port you configure
    - You can use the same monitor point configuration as Client Mode
    
    See the **Server Mode** section of this guide for detailed configuration steps.

??? question "What can I do with Modbus (TCP) Server Mode?"
    **Server Mode** enables several professional workflows:
    
    **1. Test and Validate Your Setup**
    - Use two phones: one in **Master (Client)** mode, one in **Server** mode
    - Have them talk to each other to test configuration, addresses, and data types
    - Great for learning and troubleshooting without external equipment
    
    **2. Extract Sensor Data from Your Phone**
    - Read phone sensors remotely via Modbus TCP: GPS location, orientation, light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, etc.
    - Connect your Modbus controller to your phone's Sensor Server to receive real-time sensor data
    - Perfect for mobile data collection and IoT applications
    
    **3. Multi-Platform Monitoring**
    - Run **Server Mode** on tablet/minicomputer
    - Have desktop apps (XPF, QModMaster) or other devices poll your Android server
    - Enables remote monitoring via Modbus TCP without additional hardware
    
    **Port Conflict Check**: Ensure no other apps are using your selected port. Test with ports **8888**, **9999**, or **5020** first.
    
    See the [:octicons-server-24: Sensor Server feature section](#sensor-server-mode) for sensor-specific applications.

??? question "What is Sensor Server?"
    **Sensor Server** is an extension of Server Mode that turns your Android device into a **portable Modbus TCP server publishing sensor data**.
    
    **What It Does**:
    - Converts Android device sensors into Modbus TCP registers
    - Clients can poll your phone/tablet remotely to read sensor values
    - Sensor types: GPS (latitude/longitude/altitude), light, accelerometer (X/Y/Z), gyroscope, barometer, etc.
    - Raw sensor data is automatically stuffed into 6 consecutive Modbus TCP registers
    
    **Common Applications**:
    - **Mobile asset tracking**: GPS-enabled monitoring points for vehicles/equipment
    - **Environmental monitoring**: Light and pressure sensors for facility management
    - **Motion detection**: Accelerometer and gyroscope for vibration analysis
    - **Sensor research**: Validate sensor data before production deployment
    - **IoT prototyping**: Quickly add Android sensor data to industrial workflows
    
    **No Extra Purchase Required**: This feature is included with Modbus Monitor Advanced; no additional add-ons needed.
    
    For detailed setup and examples, see [:material-dip-switch: Sensor Server Mode](#sensor-server-mode) section.
