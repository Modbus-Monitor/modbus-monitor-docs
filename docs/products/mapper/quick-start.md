1. Click the **Mode Button** (bottom right of the application)
2. Select **Listen Only** mode
3. You're ready to connect!

!!! note "Other Modes"
    Once you're comfortable, explore **Mode 2 (Pass-Through)** and **Mode 3 (Multiplex)** — see [User Manual: Operating Modes](user-manual.md#operating-modes-complete-guide) for details. Note: These modes require network reconfiguration.

### Step 3: Connect Your RS485 Adapter & Start Listening

#### What You're Doing
You're tapping into the RS485 cable (like plugging in a phone to hear a conversation without being part of it).

#### How to Connect

**Find your RS485 cable:**
- Usually 2 wires going to Modbus devices
- Often labeled A and B (or sometimes +/- or D+/D-)
- Also find the Ground wire

**Connect your adapter:**
```
Existing RS485 Cable          Your USB Adapter
    A ─────────────────────────→ A
    B ─────────────────────────→ B
   GND ─────────────────────────→ GND
    
Plug adapter into your computer USB port
```

!!! warning "Important"
    Don't disconnect anything. Just tap in. You're only listening, not interrupting.

#### Software Setup

1. **Pick COM Port**
   
      - Plug in the USB adapter
      - In Mapper Pro, select which COM port it's using
      - (Check Windows Device Manager if unsure — look for COM3, COM4, etc.)
   
2. **Set Speed (Baud Rate)**
   
      - Ask your device manager what baud rate your system uses
      - Common ones: 9600, 19200, 38400
      - Pick from the dropdown
   
3. **Configure Server Settings**
   
      - **Server:** ✅ Enable
      - **Port:** COM15 (depends on your adapter)
      - **Baud:** 19200 (check your device documentation)
      - **Parity:** None (typical)
      - **Data Bits:** 8 (typical)
      - **Stop Bits:** 1 (typical)
      - **Listen Only [RS-485]:** ON
   
4. **Click "Start" to begin monitoring**
   
   - Mapper Pro is now capturing all Modbus traffic

Within seconds, you'll see:

- ✅ Devices talking
- ✅ All the data they exchange
- ✅ Register addresses
- ✅ Data values in readable format

### Step 4: See What Your Devices Are Doing

Once monitoring starts, you'll see three main views:

#### Client Requests View — "What Are They Asking For?"
Shows every question being asked to devices:

![Modbus Mapper Pro Client Request Tab](../../assets/screenshots/mapper/modbus-mapper-pro-client-request.webp){.screenshot-center loading="lazy"}

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Slave ID | Modbus device address being queried | `1`, `17` |
| Function | Modbus function code of the request | `03 Read Holding Registers`, `04 Read Input Registers`, `16 Write Multiple Registers` |
| Address | Modbus Base register/coil address in standard format | `40001`, `30001`, `00001` |
| Address6D | 6-digit addressing format for clarity and consistency | See guide: [6-Digit Addressing](../../guides/6-digit-addressing.md) |
| Count | Number of registers/coils requested | `1`, `2`, `10` |

**What to notice:** If you see 100+ different requests, that's normal. Devices are busy!

#### Modbus Map (Data View) — "What Are The Values?"
This view lets you transform raw Modbus registers into meaningful values. Use data type, byte swap, gain, and offset to convert readings into human-friendly units (similar to Modbus Monitor XPF).

![Modbus mapper pro modbus map View](../../assets/screenshots/mapper/modbus-mapper-pro-modbus-map-view.webp){.screenshot-center loading="lazy"}

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Save | Export the Modbus Map to CSV for use in other tools (e.g., Modbus Monitor XPF) |
| Open | Load a previously saved Modbus Map (local or exported from XPF) |
| + (Add) | Add a monitoring point for an address to apply post-processing |
| - (Remove) | Remove the selected monitoring point from the list |
| [[+]] (Add All) | Automatically add monitoring points for newly discovered requests |
| Delete | Clear all monitoring points from the current map |
| Add | Automatically add or update values from client responses |
| Auto Update | Periodically refresh values from internal captured memory |


1. Click **"Create Map"** or **"Add All"**
2. All discovered data appears as a table (like Excel)
3. Each row shows one piece of data with its current value
4. Change the name to something meaningful:
   
      - Change "Register 100" to "Temperature" 
      - Change "Register 101" to "Pressure"
5. Check the **"Auto Update"** box to watch values change in real-time

**Example:**
```
Name           Value     Units
Temperature    23.5      °C
Pressure       101.3     kPa
Status         Running   (text)
```

#### Messages/Logs Tab — "What's Happening Right Now?"
This tab shows live raw traffic captured in all modes. Use it to verify requests/responses, spot errors, and understand timing.

![Modbus mapper pro traffic view](../../assets/screenshots/mapper/modbus-mapper-pro-traffic-view.webp){.screenshot-center loading="lazy"}

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Save | Save the traffic log to a file for later analysis |
| Delete | Clear the current log entries |
| Log On | Toggle logging visibility (show/hide traffic) |
| Scroll | Enable auto-scroll to keep the latest messages in view |

**Pro tip:** Turn on **"Auto Scroll"** so new messages appear at the bottom automatically.

Shows every single message:

- Raw data that was sent
- Raw response that came back
- What it all means in English
- When it happened (timestamp)

**Use this for:** Understanding problems, seeing errors, timing analysis

### Step 5: Save Your Discoveries

Once you've built your Modbus map:

- **Save the map** for documentation purposes.
- **Copy data** to clipboard for sharing
- **Export configuration** for use in other applications (Modbus Map View - Save)
- **Use with Modbus Monitor XPF** for active monitoring and control

## Troubleshooting

## Common First-Time Issues

### No Traffic Detected
**Causes & Solutions:**
- Wrong COM port → Check Device Manager for correct port
- Wrong baud rate → Try common rates: 9600, 19200, 38400
- Bad connections → Verify A/B wiring and ground
- Network inactive → Ensure HMI is actually polling

### Garbled Data
**Causes & Solutions:**
- Wrong baud rate → Match network settings exactly
- Wrong parity/stop bits → Check network configuration  
- Electrical interference → Improve cable routing/shielding
- Ground loops → Isolate monitoring connection

### Partial Capture
**Causes & Solutions:**
- High traffic volume → Increase buffer settings
- USB adapter limitations → Use industrial-grade adapter
- Timing issues → Adjust capture timing parameters

## What's Next?

### Immediate Actions
1. **Document discoveries** - Export captured register maps
2. **Identify patterns** - Note polling frequencies and sequences  
3. **Validate findings** - Cross-reference with known system behavior

### Advanced Usage
- **Set up continuous monitoring** for long-term analysis
- **Compare before/after** system changes  
- **Export data** for inclusion in system documentation
- **Share findings** with team members
