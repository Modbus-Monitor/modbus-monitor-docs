## Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Prerequisites

- ✅ Modbus Monitor XPF installed  
- ✅ ThingSpeak Add-on purchased  
- ✅ ThingSpeak channel created with Write API Key ([see Overview Guide](thingspeak-overview.md#getting-started-all-platforms))

### Step 1: Configure ThingSpeak Add-On

1. Open **IoT** Tab → **ThingSpeak** Group
2. Enter **API Key**: Paste from ThingSpeak Write API Key from your channel and account
3. Update **Interval**: `30000` Send updates every 30s
4. Toggle **Enable** to automatically log data to cloud.

### Step 2: Start Polling

1. Connect to your Modbus device
2. Click **Start** in the Client Tab
3. Your monitor points automatically upload to ThingSpeak

### Step 3: View Your Data

1. Open [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com)
2. Go to your channel → **Private View**
3. See live charts updating with your Modbus data

**Done!** Your data is now logging to the cloud.

## How It Works

### Automatic Field Mapping

Monitor points from your project automatically map to ThingSpeak Fields 1–8 **in the order they appear**:

```
Your Monitor Points:    ThingSpeak Channel:
1. Tank Level      →    Field 1
2. Motor Speed     →    Field 2
3. Temperature     →    Field 3
4. Pressure        →    Field 4
5. Flow Rate       →    Field 5
6. Humidity        →    Field 6
7. Voltage         →    Field 7
8. Current         →    Field 8
```

**⚠️ Limit:** ThingSpeak supports 8 fields maximum. Only your first 8 monitor points upload.

**To change what uploads:** Reorder your monitor points in **Project** → **Modbus Points** using the drag handle. Changes take effect on the next upload cycle.

### Update Interval

Data uploads to ThingSpeak based on your polling interval: **Interval** → **Update Interval (ms)**

**ThingSpeak Requirements:**

- **Minimum:** 15000 seconds for free tier
- **Recommended:** 30–60 seconds for balanced performance
- The scan timing can be adujsted from the Timeout group in the Client Tab. For detailed configuration related to Timing, see [XPF Guide → Time Group](../products/xpf/user-guide.md#timeout-settings).

## Windows XPF Features

### Add-On Settings

**Required Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Write API Key** | `ABCDEFG1234567890` | ThingSpeak → API Keys tab |
| **Update Interval (ms)** | `30000` | Min 15000ms (free), 1000ms (paid) |

### Working with Projects

**Create Project for ThingSpeak:**

1. **File** → **New Project**
2. Add monitor points for data you want to log
3. **Tools** → **Add-Ons** → **ThingSpeak** → Configure
4. **Save Project** with descriptive name

**Load Project Later:**

1. **File** → **Recent** or **Open**
2. XPF remembers your ThingSpeak settings
3. Click **Start Polling** to resume logging

---

## Verification & Testing

### Check if it's working

1. **Enable ThingSpeak** in Add-On settings
2. **Start Polling** on main screen
3. **Open ThingSpeak** → Your Channel → **Private View**
4. **Look for new data points** with recent timestamps

**Enable Debug Logging:**
- **Tools** → **Add-Ons** → **ThingSpeak** → Advanced → **Enable Verbose Logging**
- **View** → **Event Log** for detailed diagnostics

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Invalid API Key" error** | Verify key matches ThingSpeak Write API Key exactly |
| **"Channel not found" error** | Confirm Channel ID is numeric and matches ThingSpeak |
| **Uploads rate-limited** | Increase interval to ≥15 seconds |
| **No data uploaded** | Check internet connection and Event Log for errors |
| **Only first 8 points** | ThingSpeak max 8 fields per channel |

## Common Tasks

**How do I view uploaded data?**  
ThingSpeak → Your Channel → Private View (or Public View)

**Can multiple PCs upload to same channel?**  
Yes, but coordinate Channel ID and API Key. Data from all sources merges chronologically.

**How do I back up my data?**  
ThingSpeak → Data Import/Export → Download as CSV/JSON

**Can I analyze data with MATLAB?**  
Yes: ThingSpeak has built-in MATLAB integration. See the [Overview Guide](thingspeak-overview.md) or [ThingSpeak documentation](https://thingspeak.com/docs) for MATLAB integration details.

**Do I need paid ThingSpeak?**  
Free tier works for most uses. Limits:
- 8 fields per channel
- 15-second minimum update interval
- 3 months data history
