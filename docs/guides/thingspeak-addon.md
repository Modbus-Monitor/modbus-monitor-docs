## Configuration Details

### Add-On Settings

**Required Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Write API Key** | `ABCDEFG1234567890` | ThingSpeak → Your Channel → API Keys |
| **Channel ID** | `123456` | ThingSpeak channel details page |
| **Update Interval (sec)** | `30` | Min 15s (free), 1s (paid); recommend 30-60s |

**Optional Settings:**

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Include Device Status** | Upload XPF app status/connectivity |
| **Device Name** | Identifier for status field |
| **Proxy Settings** | If behind corporate firewall |

### Monitor Point to Field Mapping

**XPF automatically maps monitor points to ThingSpeak fields in order:**

```
Your Monitor List (XPF):    ThingSpeak Channel:
1. Tank Level        →      Field 1
2. Motor Speed       →      Field 2
3. Temperature       →      Field 3
4. Pressure          →      Field 4
...
8. Flow Rate         →      Field 8
```

**⚠️ Important**: Only first 8 monitor points upload (ThingSpeak max 8 fields per channel)

**To change what uploads:**
- Reorder monitor points in **Project** → **Modbus Points** using drag handle
- Changes take effect on next upload cycle

### Verify Field Mapping

1. **View Communication Log**
   - **View** → **Communication Log**

2. **Start Polling**
   - Watch log for ThingSpeak data transmission
   - Verify field1-8 values are correct

3. **Check ThingSpeak Dashboard**
   - Confirm recent data appears with correct values

**Example Communication Log:**
```
Starting Sample Data to ThingSpeak
field1 (Tank Level)=50 field2(Motor Speed)=1200 field3(Temperature)=75 
https://api.thingspeak.com/update.js?api_key=R3ERUXXXZ4I6XXXX&field1=50&field2=1200&field3=75
Response OK
Sample Data Successfully Written
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Update Intervals

**ThingSpeak Limits:**

| Tier | Min Interval | Max Rate |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | 15 seconds | 3M messages/year |
| **Paid** | 1 second | Unlimited |

**Recommended Settings:**

| Application | Interval | Reason |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Critical Monitoring | 10-30s | Fast response to alerts |
| Standard Industrial | 30-60s | Balanced data & bandwidth |
| Environmental Data | 5-15 min | Less frequent changes |

### Handling >8 Monitor Points

**Limitation**: ThingSpeak supports max 8 fields per channel. Solutions:

1. **Prioritize Top 8**: Reorder points, log most important
2. **Multiple Channels**: Create separate ThingSpeak channels
3. **Use MQTT**: MQTT add-on supports unlimited fields

### Device Disconnections

**Automatic Reconnect:**
- XPF retries failed uploads automatically
- Failed entries queue locally
- Check **Connection Status** in Add-On settings

**Manual Recovery:**
1. Right-click XPF tray icon → **Reconnect Add-Ons**
2. Or restart XPF application

## Verification & Testing

### Manual Test Setup

1. **Create test channel** in ThingSpeak (separate from production)
2. **Add 3-4 simple monitor points** in XPF
3. **Configure add-on** with test channel details
4. **Start polling** for 2 cycles (1+ minute)
5. **Verify**:
   - Private View shows 2+ recent timestamps
   - Field values match XPF readings

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"Invalid API Key" error** | Verify key matches ThingSpeak Write API Key exactly |
| **"Channel not found" error** | Confirm Channel ID is numeric and correct |
| **Uploads rate-limited** | Increase interval to ≥15 seconds |
| **Partial data uploaded** | Check that first 8 points are readable |
| **No uploads occurring** | Is internet connected? Check Event Log |

**Enable Debug Logging:**
- **Add-On Settings** → **Advanced** → **Enable Verbose Logging**
- Check **Event Log** for detailed diagnostics

## XPF-Specific Features

### Working with Projects

**Create Project for ThingSpeak:**
1. **File** → **New Project**
2. Add monitor points for data you want to log
3. **Tools** → **Add-Ons** → **ThingSpeak**
4. Enable and configure with channel details
5. **Save Project** with descriptive name

**Load Project Later:**
1. **File** → **Recent** or **Open**
2. XPF remembers ThingSpeak settings
3. Click **Start Polling** to resume logging

### Local Data Export

**Backup Before Cloud Upload:**
- **Tools** → **Export Data** → Select date range
- Export to CSV for offline analysis
- Useful for compliance/backup

**Combined Workflow:**
1. Poll device → collect local data in XPF
2. Simultaneously upload to ThingSpeak
3. Export CSV for archive

### Scheduled Polling

**24/7 Continuous Monitoring:**
- Use Windows Task Scheduler to launch XPF at intervals
- XPF opens → polls → uploads → closes
- Useful for unattended monitoring

**Example Task Scheduler Setup:**
```
Trigger: Every 30 minutes
Run: "C:\Program Files\Modbus Monitor XPF\ModbusMonitor.exe" myproject.xpf
```

## Common Tasks

**How do I view uploaded data?**  
ThingSpeak → Your Channel → Private View (or Public View)

**Can multiple PCs upload to same channel?**  
Yes, but coordinate Channel ID and API Key. Data merges chronologically.

**How do I back up data?**  
ThingSpeak → Data Import/Export → Download CSV/JSON

**Can I analyze data with MATLAB?**  
Yes. ThingSpeak has built-in MATLAB integration. See the [Overview Guide](thingspeak-overview.md) or [ThingSpeak documentation](https://thingspeak.com/docs) for MATLAB integration details.

**What if I have >8 monitor points?**  
Only first 8 upload. Solutions:
- Create multiple ThingSpeak channels
- Use MQTT or Google Sheets add-ons
- Prioritize which 8 points to log

**Do I need paid ThingSpeak?**  
Free tier works for most uses:
- 8 fields per channel
- 15-second minimum interval
- 3 months data history
