## XPF's Revolutionary MQTT Capabilities

**Modbus Monitor XPF is the only tool that provides complete bidirectional MQTT integration in both Client and Server modes** - eliminating the need for multiple software tools and dramatically simplifying MQTT development and deployment.

### Unique Bidirectional Architecture

!!! success "Industry-First Capabilities"
    **XPF combines Publisher + Subscriber + MQTT Test Tools in one application:**
    
    **Publisher Mode (Client Mode Active)**
    - XPF polls Modbus devices and publishes data to MQTT broker
    - Perfect for: Sending sensor data, status updates, alarms to cloud
    
    **Subscriber Mode (MQTT Data Reception)**  
    - XPF receives MQTT messages and updates Monitor Points grid in real-time
    - Perfect for: External data integration, multi-protocol monitoring, development testing
    - **Works independently**: No need for Modbus Client/Server to be running
    
    **Built-in MQTT Test Tools**
    - Integrated MQTT client for testing and debugging
    - No need for separate test applications
    - Save hours of setup time and eliminate tool confusion

### Why This is Revolutionary

| Traditional Approach | XPF Integrated Approach | Time Savings |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Modbus Client Software** | **XPF Client Mode** | |
| + **Separate MQTT Publisher** | (Built into XPF) | **60-80% faster** |
| + **Separate MQTT Subscriber** | **XPF Server Mode** | |
| + **MQTT Test Client** | **Built-in Test Tools** | |
| + **Integration Coding** | (No coding needed) | |
| = 4+ separate tools | = **One XPF License** | **75% cost reduction** |

### Bidirectional Use Cases

**Industrial Automation (Both Directions)**
```yaml
Uplink (XPF Client to MQTT):
  - Temperature sensors to Cloud dashboard
  - Production counts to Analytics platform  
  - Alarm states to Notification system

Downlink (MQTT to XPF Monitor Points):
  - External sensor data to Monitor Points grid
  - Cloud service data to unified monitoring view
  - Test data injection for dashboard development
```

**IoT Data Aggregation (Complete Solution)**
```yaml
Multi-Source Monitoring:
  - Collect from Modbus devices via polling (Client mode)
  - Receive external data via MQTT subscriptions (Data Reception)
  - Display unified view in Monitor Points grid
  - Publish combined analytics to cloud (Publisher)
  - Independent operation of each data source
```

**Development & Testing (Integrated Tools)**
```yaml
Development Workflow:
  1. Use MQTT publishers to inject test data into Monitor Points
  2. Test monitoring dashboards with simulated data
  3. Verify data processing with integrated MQTT client
  4. Deploy same XPF configuration to production with real Modbus devices
```

!!! tip "No Other Tool Does This"
    **XPF eliminates the complexity of:**

    - Learning multiple MQTT client applications
    - Integrating separate publisher/subscriber tools  
    - Writing custom code to bridge Modbus and MQTT
    - Managing multiple software licenses and configurations
    - Debugging communication between separate tools

This guide will show you how to leverage both directions plus the integrated test tools for complete MQTT solutions.

## Quick Start: Connect to Public MQTT Brokers

        - The `#` wildcard will capture all messages starting with `xpf/`
        - Click Back button, `3`
      - Click "Connect", `4`
      - MQTT Explorer shows **Connected** status

### Step 3: Verify MQTT Explorer Setup

3. **Verify Subscription Setup**
      - MQTT Explorer should show the `xpf/#` topic in the subscription list
      - This will monitor all messages from your XPF configuration
      - Leave MQTT Explorer running to capture incoming messages
      - Position windows so you can see both XPF and MQTT Explorer

!!! tip "MQTT Client Subscription Behavior"
    **Different MQTT client applications handle subscriptions differently:**
    
    - **MQTT Explorer**: Requires topic subscriptions in the Advanced section BEFORE connecting
    - **Other MQTT clients**: May allow subscriptions after connecting (varies by software)
    
    **Always check your specific MQTT client's requirements.** Our examples use MQTT Explorer, which needs pre-connection setup. See [Step 2: Configure Topics](#step-2-configure-topics) for detailed XPF topic configuration.

---

## Part C: Test and Verify Connection

**Configure XPF monitor points and test the complete MQTT flow:**

### Step 1: Configure XPF Monitor Points for MQTT

1. **Configure Monitor Points for MQTT Publishing**
   - In XPF, locate the monitor points you want to publish to MQTT
   - In the **Name** field for each monitor point, enter the MQTT topic name that matches what you configured in MQTT Explorer
   - **Example**: If you subscribed to `xpf/#` in MQTT Explorer, name your monitor points like:
     - `xpf/Sample Holding Register` 
     - `xpf/Sample Input Register`
     - `xpf/Discrete Input Register`
     - `xpf/Coil Register`
     - This ensures the published MQTT messages appear under the correct topic tree in MQTT Explorer      
      ![Modbus Monitor XPF MQTT Topics Subscribe](../assets/screenshots/xpf/xpf-iot-topics-publish.webp){ width="600" loading="lazy" }

### Step 2: Enable Communication Logging

2. **Enable Communication Logging** to see detailed MQTT activity
      - **General Communication Log**: In XPF, go to **Home Tab** > **Log** > **Show** and click **Start**
      - **MQTT-Specific Debug Log**: Go to **IoT Tab** > **MQTT Group** > **Debug Log Button** and click **Start**
      - The MQTT Debug Log provides detailed connection, authentication, and message flow information specifically for MQTT operations
      - **For detailed logging setup**: See [Communication Logging](../products/xpf/user-guide.md#log-group) in the XPF User Guide

### Step 3: Start MQTT Communication

3. **Start MQTT Communication**
      - Click the **Start** button in IoT Tab > MQTT Group > Start
      - Verify connection success by checking:
        - XPF displays "Connected" status 
        - MQTT icon changes to green (connected state)
        - Watch the Communication Log for MQTT connection messages:
          ```          
            03:33:03:937839,MQTT Start/Stop Toggle
            03:33:04:760154,Connected to MQTT Broker
            03:33:13:289810,xpf/Sample Holding Register : 40001
            03:33:13:290089,xpf/Sample Input Register : 30001
            03:33:13:290243,xpf/Discrete Input Register : 1
            03:33:13:290382,xpf/Coil Register : 1
          ```

### Step 4: Publish Sample Data to MQTT Broker
1. **Use XPF's Test/Sample Publishing Feature**
      - In XPF MQTT interface, locate the **Send Sample** or **Test Publish** button
      - Click the button to publish all configured monitor points as sample data
      - This sends a one-time test message for each monitor point to verify connectivity
      - Watch MQTT Explorer to confirm messages are received in real-time

2. **Verify Test Message Flow**
      - Check that MQTT Explorer receives the test messages immediately
      - Confirm message format, content, and values match your monitor points
      - Communication Log should show published test messages with timestamps:
         ```          
            03:33:13:289810,xpf/Sample Holding Register : 40001
            03:33:13:290089,xpf/Sample Input Register : 30001
            03:33:13:290243,xpf/Discrete Input Register : 1
            03:33:13:290382,xpf/Coil Register : 1
         ```
      - Stop the Communication Logging and close the Log window after successful test verification

### Certificate-Based Authentication

#### Understanding Certificate Authentication

Certificate authentication provides enhanced security for MQTT connections through cryptographic validation. There are two types of certificates used in MQTT security:

**1. CA (Certificate Authority) Certificate**

   - **Purpose**: Validates the broker's identity (server authentication)      
   - **When to use**: When connecting to brokers with custom/private certificates
   - **Security benefit**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying broker authenticity

**2. Client Certificate**

   - **Purpose**: Authenticates your device to the broker (client authentication)
   - **When to use**: When broker requires mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication
   - **Security benefit**: Ensures only authorized devices can connect

#### When to Use Certificates

| Scenario | CA Certificate | Client Certificate | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Public brokers** (HiveMQ, EMQX public) | Optional (auto-detect) | Not supported | Basic testing, learning |
| **Private cloud brokers** (EMQX Cloud, HiveMQ Cloud) | Required (download from provider) | Optional | Secure production deployment |
| **Enterprise environments** | Required (from IT department) | Required | High-security, compliance requirements |
| **Self-hosted brokers** | Required (your own CA) | Required | Complete control and security |

#### EMQX Cloud Certificate Configuration

**EMQX provides downloadable CA certificates for secure connections** - making it an excellent example for demonstrating explicit certificate configuration:

!!! info "Why EMQX for CA Certificate Example"
    **EMQX Cloud offers free CA certificate downloads** with clear visibility of expiration dates, making it perfect for learning certificate management:
    
    - **HiveMQ Cloud**: Uses auto-detect certificates (easier but less transparent)
    - **EMQX Cloud**: Provides downloadable CA certificates (explicit trust chain)
    - **Learning benefit**: Shows proper certificate management workflow
    - **Production ready**: Same approach used in enterprise environments

**EMQX provides downloadable CA certificates for secure connections:**

![EMQX CA Certificate](../assets/screenshots/xpf/xpf-iot-emqx-ca2.webp){ loading="lazy"}

1. **Download CA Certificate from EMQX Console**
      - Log into your EMQX deployment console (as shown in screenshot)
      - Navigate to **Deployment Overview** → **MQTT Connection Information**
      - Click **CA Certificate** download link (shows "CA Certificate Expiration: 2031.11.09")
      - Save the certificate file (usually named `ca.crt` or similar)
      
2. **Configure XPF with EMQX CA Certificate**
   ```yaml
   XPF Configuration:
     Broker Host: caxxxx4e.ala.us-east-1.emqxsl.com (your EMQX endpoint)
     Port: 8883 (TLS port)
     TLS/SSL: ✓ Enabled
     CA Certificate: [Browse] → Select downloaded ca.crt file
     Client Certificate: Leave empty (for username/password auth)
   ```

3. **Set CA Certificate Path in XPF**
   - In XPF MQTT settings, locate the **CA Certificate** button (file icon)
   - Click the **CA Certificate** button to open file browser
   - Navigate to your downloaded CA certificate file
   - Select the certificate file (e.g., `ca.crt`, `emqx-ca.pem`)
   - XPF will display the certificate path in the field

### Client Certificate Authentication

For high-security environments requiring mutual authentication:

!!! warning "Advanced Setup"
    Client certificates require PKI knowledge and certificate management. Only recommended for enterprise environments with proper certificate infrastructure.

#### When Client Certificates Are Required

**Industrial & Enterprise Scenarios:**

- **Manufacturing Plants**: PLCs and SCADA systems requiring device authentication
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Power plants, water treatment, transportation systems
- **Compliance Environments**: ISO 27001, IEC 62443, SOX, HIPAA requirements
- **Zero-Trust Networks**: All devices must be cryptographically authenticated
- **Multi-Tenant Brokers**: Shared MQTT infrastructure requiring device isolation

**Security Benefits:**

- **Device Identity Verification**: Each device has unique cryptographic identity
- **Non-Repudiation**: Cryptographic proof of device actions and commands
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions based on certificate attributes
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of authenticated device communications

**Typical Implementation:**
```yaml
Enterprise Setup:
  CA Certificate: Company's root certificate authority
  Client Certificate: Device-specific certificate signed by company CA
  Broker Configuration: Requires both server and client authentication
  Access Control: MQTT topics mapped to certificate attributes
```

#### Generate Client Certificate (optional)
```bash
# Create private key and certificate
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client-key.pem
openssl req -new -key client-key.pem -out client.csr
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -signkey client-key.pem -out client-cert.pem

# Convert to PFX for XPF
openssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx -inkey client-key.pem -in client-cert.pem
```

#### Configure XPF with Certificates

**XPF Certificate Configuration Steps:**

1. **Open XPF MQTT Settings**   
      - Navigate to **IoT Tab** > **MQTT Group** > **Settings**
      - Enable **TLS/SSL** checkbox first

2. **Set CA Certificate Path**
      - Click the **CA Certificate** button (file certificate icon)
      - Browse to your downloaded CA certificate file
      - Select the certificate file (e.g., `ca.crt`, `emqx-ca.pem`, `your-company-ca.crt`)
      - XPF displays the full path in the field

3. **Set Client Certificate Path** (if required)
      - Click the **Client Certificate** button (file certificate icon)  
      - Browse to your client certificate file (must be in PFX format)
      - Select the certificate file (e.g., `client.pfx`, `device-cert.pfx`)
      - Enter the certificate password when prompted

4. **Complete Configuration**
   ```yaml
   Broker Configuration:
     Broker Host: secure-broker.yourcompany.com (or EMQX endpoint)
     Port: 8883 (TLS port)
     Client ID: XPF-Device-001 (must match certificate CN if using client certs)
     TLS/SSL: ✓ Enabled
     
   Certificate Configuration:
     CA Certificate: [Full path displayed after browsing]
     Client Certificate: [Full path displayed after browsing, PFX format]
     Certificate Password: [Entered during PFX selection]
   ```

**Certificate File Format Requirements:**
- **CA Certificate**: `.crt`, `.pem`, `.cer` formats supported
- **Client Certificate**: Must be `.pfx` (PKCS#12) format containing both certificate and private key
- **Certificate Path**: XPF stores and displays the full file path after selection

!!! tip "Certificate Management in XPF"
    **XPF Certificate UI Features:**
    
    - **File Browser Integration**: Certificate buttons open standard file dialogs
    - **Path Validation**: XPF validates certificate file format and accessibility  
    - **Secure Storage**: Certificate paths stored in XPF configuration (passwords not stored)
    - **Certificate Icons**: File certificate icons clearly identify certificate configuration buttons

### Authentication vs Authorization

Understanding the difference between authentication (who you are) and authorization (what you can do) is crucial for proper MQTT security implementation.

#### Authentication: "Who Are You?"

**Authentication Methods by Complexity:**

| Method | Security Level | Use Case | Username Required | Notes |
|--------|----------------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Anonymous** | None | Public testing only | No | Anyone can connect |
| **Username/Password** | Basic | Development, cloud services | Yes | Simple credential-based auth |
| **CA Certificate Only** | Medium | Verified server identity | Yes (usually) | Validates broker, not client |
| **Client Certificate** | High | Enterprise environments | No* | Cryptographic device identity |
| **Client Cert + Username** | Highest | Maximum security | Yes | Both crypto and credential auth |

*Client certificates can replace username/password but may be used together for defense in depth.

#### Authorization: "What Can You Do?"

**After authentication, authorization controls access to topics and operations:**

**HiveMQ Cloud Authorization Example:**
```yaml
Topic Permissions (configured in broker):
  User "sensor-device":
    - CAN publish to: "sensors/+/data"
    - CANNOT publish to: "commands/#"
    - CAN subscribe to: "sensors/sensor-001/config"
    
  User "control-dashboard":
    - CAN publish to: "commands/#"
    - CAN subscribe to: "sensors/+/data"
    - CAN subscribe to: "alarms/#"
```

#### Recommended Configurations by Use Case

=== "Beginner (Learning & Testing)"

    **Goal**: Get started quickly with minimal complexity
    
    **Authentication**: Username/Password
    ```yaml
    XPF Configuration:
      TLS/SSL: ✓ Enabled (use 8883)
      CA Certificate: Auto-detect
      Username: your-hivemq-username
      Password: your-hivemq-password
      Client Certificate: (leave empty)
    ```
    
    **Authorization**: Default permissions (can publish/subscribe to all topics)
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Quick setup, no certificate management
    - Encrypted connection protects data in transit
    - Good for learning and development
    
    **Limitations:**
    - Relies on shared credentials
    - Less secure than certificate-based auth

=== "Secure (Production Development)"

    **Goal**: Production-ready security with manageable complexity
    
    **Authentication**: Username/Password + Downloaded CA Certificate
    ```yaml
    XPF Configuration:
      TLS/SSL: ✓ Enabled
      CA Certificate: [Downloaded from EMQX/HiveMQ console]
      Username: production-device-001
      Password: strong-unique-password
      Client Certificate: (leave empty)
    ```
    
    **Authorization**: Topic-based permissions
    ```yaml
    Broker Configuration:
      Device Permissions:
        - PUBLISH: "factory/line1/data/#"
        - SUBSCRIBE: "factory/line1/commands/+"
        - DENY: "admin/#", "system/#"
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Explicit trust chain (no auto-detect)
    - Topic-level access control
    - Credential rotation capabilities
    
    **When to use:**
    - Production deployments
    - Multi-device installations
    - Customer-facing systems

=== "Enterprise (Maximum Security)"

    **Goal**: Highest security for critical infrastructure
    
    **Authentication**: Client Certificate + CA Certificate (mutual TLS)
    ```yaml
    XPF Configuration:
      TLS/SSL: ✓ Enabled
      CA Certificate: company-root-ca.crt
      Client Certificate: device-001.pfx
      Certificate Password: strong-pfx-password
      Username: (optional - can be derived from certificate)
    ```
    
    **Authorization**: Certificate-based permissions + topic ACLs
    ```yaml
    Broker Configuration:
      Certificate Subject: CN=XPF-Plant1-Device001
      Permitted Actions:
        - PUBLISH: "plant1/devices/001/#"
        - SUBSCRIBE: "plant1/commands/001/+"
        - DENY ALL other topics
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**

    - Cryptographic device identity
    - No shared credentials
    - Granular certificate-based permissions
    - Audit trails for all device actions
    
    **When to use:**

    - Critical infrastructure
    - Compliance environments (IEC 62443, ISO 27001)
    - Zero-trust networks
    - High-value industrial systems

#### Implementation Recommendations

**Start Simple, Scale Security:**

1. **Development Phase**: Begin with username/password + TLS
2. **Testing Phase**: Add downloaded CA certificates  
3. **Production Phase**: Implement topic-based authorization
4. **Enterprise Phase**: Add client certificates for device authentication

**Common Security Progression:**
```yaml
Phase 1: Anonymous → Username/Password + TLS
Phase 2: Add CA Certificate (explicit trust)
Phase 3: Configure topic permissions (authorization)
Phase 4: Client certificates (device identity)
```

!!! warning "Authentication vs Authorization Gotcha"
    **Client certificates replace username/password for authentication** but broker authorization policies still determine topic access. A device with a valid certificate can still be denied access to specific topics by authorization rules.

!!! tip "HiveMQ vs EMQX Authorization"
    - **HiveMQ Cloud**: Authorization configured in web console under "Access Management"
    - **EMQX Cloud**: Authorization rules configured in "Authentication & Authorization" section
    - **Both support**: Topic-based ACLs, username-based rules, certificate-based policies

### Verification

**Secure connection indicators:**

- XPF status shows "Connected (TLS)" or "Connected (WSS)"
- Communication log shows no certificate errors
- Message traffic encrypted (use Wireshark to verify)

!!! success "Production Ready"
    **Your MQTT connection is now production-ready with:**

    - ✅ Encrypted data transmission
    - ✅ Server authentication  
    - ✅ Optional client authentication
    - ✅ Firewall-friendly options

**For detailed configuration steps, see**: [Complete Setup Examples](#complete-setup-examples) section.

## MQTT Data Reception Guide: Real-Time Monitor Point Updates

XPF's MQTT subscription feature allows receiving data from MQTT brokers and updating monitor points in real-time - enabling remote data injection and external system integration. This powerful feature **works independently of Modbus Client/Server operations**, allowing you to receive data via MQTT and display it in XPF's monitor points grid regardless of whether you're actively polling Modbus devices or running a Modbus server.

<figure markdown>
  ![XPF MQTT Configuration Interface](../assets/screenshots/xpf/xpf-iot-mqtt-topics-subscribe.webp){ loading="lazy" }
  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">XPF MQTT IoT interface showing active subscription topics list with highlighted [+] button indicating topics are actively subscribed and receiving data</figcaption>
</figure>

**Interface Elements:**

| Element | Control | Function | Status Indicator |
|---------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **1** | **Subscription Topics List** | View and manage active MQTT topic subscriptions | Displays all topics currently subscribed for incoming messages |
| **2** | **[+] Subscribe to All Topics** | Subscribes to all topics in the current list | Highlighted when MQTT broker confirms successful subscription |
| **3** | **[-] Unsubscribe from All Topics** | Removes subscription from all topics in the list | Highlighted when broker confirms unsubscription status |
| **4** | **+ Add Topic** | Add new topic after typing in text box | Use for patterns like `sensors/+/data`, `commands/#` |
| **5** | **- Remove Topic** | Select topic from list and click to remove | Removes topic from subscription configuration |

### MQTT Communication Statistics

XPF provides real-time MQTT communication statistics displayed in the **T00R00E00** format in the MQTT interface:

**Statistics Format: TxxRxxExx**
- **T** (Transmit): Number of messages successfully published to the MQTT broker
- **R** (Receive): Number of messages successfully received from subscribed topics
- **E** (Error): Number of communication errors encountered (connection failures, publish errors, receive errors)

**Example Statistics Display:**
- **T125R089E003** = 125 messages sent, 89 messages received, 3 errors
- **T000R000E000** = No activity yet (initial state)
- **T045R000E001** = 45 messages published, no messages received, 1 error occurred

**Statistics Updates:**
- **Real-time counting**: Counters update immediately as MQTT operations occur
- **Persistent during session**: Counters accumulate throughout the XPF session
- **Reset capability**: Use "Reset Counters" button to clear all statistics
- **Independent tracking**: Publish/subscribe counters work independently of each other

!!! tip "Understanding MQTT Traffic Patterns"
    **Normal operation patterns:**
    - **Publishing only**: High T count, R=000 (XPF sending data to broker)
    - **Subscribing only**: T=000, high R count (XPF receiving external data)
    - **Bidirectional**: Both T and R counters increasing (full MQTT integration)
    - **Error monitoring**: E count should remain low; investigate if errors increase rapidly

**How MQTT Data Reception Works:**

  - Configure subscription topics in XPF's MQTT panel to listen for incoming messages
  - When MQTT messages arrive, XPF automatically updates the **Monitor Points data grid** with the new values
  - **Works independently**: No need to start Modbus Client or Server tabs - MQTT data updates happen automatically
  - Supports both structured JSON data and simple topic/payload formats for maximum flexibility
  - Automatically creates new monitor points or updates existing ones based on incoming MQTT data

**Key Independence Feature:**

- **Monitor Points Grid Updates**: MQTT messages directly update the visual data grid in real-time
- **No Modbus Dependency**: Works whether Modbus Client/Server tabs are running or stopped
- **Real-Time Display**: See external data flowing into XPF immediately as MQTT messages arrive
- **Flexible Data Sources**: Combine Modbus polling with MQTT data injection in the same monitor points view

**Practical Applications:**

- **External Data Integration**: Receive sensor data from IoT devices, weather stations, or cloud services via MQTT
- **Multi-Protocol Monitoring**: Combine Modbus device data with MQTT data sources in a single view
- **Remote Data Injection**: Accept data from external systems (databases, APIs, other applications) via MQTT
- **Development & Testing**: Simulate device data by publishing MQTT messages that appear in monitor points
- **Dashboard Data Sources**: Use MQTT to feed external data into XPF for unified monitoring displays

!!! tip "Multi-Source Monitoring Setup"
    **Perfect for comprehensive monitoring:** Configure some monitor points to poll Modbus devices while subscribing to MQTT topics for external data. All data appears together in the same monitor points grid, providing a unified view of your entire system.

!!! info "Bidirectional MQTT Capabilities"
    **Publishing (Outbound)**: XPF polls Modbus → publishes data to MQTT broker (covered in previous sections)  
    **Subscribing (Inbound)**: XPF receives MQTT messages → updates Monitor Points grid → displays real-time data from any MQTT source

**Supported Message Formats:**
- **Complete JSON DTO Format**: Full register details with all Modbus configuration parameters
- **Simple Topic/Payload**: Topic name becomes monitor point name, payload becomes the value  
- **Automatic Point Management**: Creates new monitor points or updates existing ones based on address, unit ID, and register type matching

**Complete JSON DTO Format (Published by XPF when Modbus Client is running):**
```json
{
  "RegName": "ModbusMonitor/Signed",
  "RegAddress": 400001,
  "RegUnitID": 1,
  "RegGain": 1,
  "RegOffset": 0,
  "RegType": "UINT16",
  "RegByteSwap": "ABCD_BE",
  "RegValue": "204",
  "OneBased": false,
  "HasError": false
}
```

**JSON DTO Field Descriptions:**
- **RegName**: Monitor point display name 
- **RegAddress**: Modbus register address
- **RegUnitID**: Modbus device unit/slave ID
- **RegGain**: Scaling gain factor applied to raw value
- **RegOffset**: Scaling offset applied to raw value  
- **RegType**: Modbus register type (UINT16, SINT16, UINT32, etc.)
- **RegByteSwap**: Byte order configuration (ABCD_BE, DCBA_LE, etc.)
- **RegValue**: Current processed value (after gain/offset scaling)
- **OneBased**: Address format (true=1-based, false=0-based addressing)
- **HasError**: Error status (true if communication/processing error occurred)

### MQTT Subscription Setup

#### Step 1: Configure MQTT Subscription Topics

1. **Open MQTT Panel in XPF**
   - Navigate to the MQTT Add-on panel in XPF
   - Locate the **Subscription Topics** list/configuration area
   - **Important**: Ensure MQTT broker connection is configured and working (see previous sections)

2. **Add Subscription Topics**
   ```yaml
   Example Subscription Topics:
     - "sensors/temperature/+" - Temperature data from multiple sensors
     - "external/weather/data" - Weather service data
     - "system/alarms/#" - System alarm messages  
     - "devices/+/status" - Device status updates
   
   Message Processing:
     - JSON DTO format: Full register details in structured format
     - Simple format: Topic name → Monitor Point name, Payload → Value
     - Automatic point creation: New monitor points added if not existing
   ```

#### Step 2: Message Format Options

**Option A: Complete JSON DTO Format (Published by XPF)**
```json
Topic: "sensors/temperature/room1"
Message: {
  "RegName": "Room1 Temperature",
  "RegAddress": 40001,
  "RegUnitID": 1,
  "RegGain": 0.1,
  "RegOffset": -273.15,
  "RegType": "SINT16",
  "RegByteSwap": "ABCD_BE",
  "RegValue": "23.5",
  "OneBased": false,
  "HasError": false
}
Result: Creates/updates monitor point with complete register configuration and scaling
```

**Option B: Simplified JSON Format (For External Publishers)**
```json
Topic: "sensors/temperature/room1"
Message: {
  "RegName": "Room1 Temperature",
  "RegValue": "23.5",
  "RegAddress": "40001", 
  "RegType": "Holding Register",
  "RegUnitID": "1"
}
Result: Creates/updates monitor point with basic register details
```

**Option C: Simple Topic/Payload Format**
```json
Topic: "sensors/humidity/room1"
Message: "65.2"
Result: Creates monitor point named "sensors/humidity/room1" with value "65.2"
```

!!! info "Message Format Usage"
    **When XPF Publishes (Outbound):**
    - **Complete JSON DTO**: Used when Modbus Client tab is running and publishing monitor point data
    - Includes all Modbus configuration details for complete data reconstruction
    
    **When XPF Receives (Inbound):**
    - **Complete JSON DTO**: Full compatibility with XPF-published messages (bidirectional)
    - **Simplified JSON**: Basic register details for external system integration
    - **Simple Topic/Payload**: Lightweight format for basic data injection
    
    **Bidirectional Compatibility**: XPF instances can exchange complete JSON DTO messages for full monitor point synchronization between systems.

#### Step 3: Test MQTT Data Reception

1. **Start MQTT Connection**
   - Click **Connect** in MQTT panel
   - Verify "Connected" status shows
   - Monitor connection log for successful subscription confirmations

2. **Send Test Data**
   - Use MQTT client to publish to your subscription topics
   - **Monitor Points Grid should update immediately** with new/changed values
   - Check Communication Log for received message confirmations:
     ```          
        14:33:13: MQTT Message Received: Topic: sensors/temp/room1, Payload: 24.8
        14:33:13: Updated monitor point: sensors/temp/room1 = 24.8
     ```

3. **Verify Independent Operation**
   - **Monitor Points update regardless** of Modbus Client/Server tab status
   - Data flows into grid whether Modbus operations are active or not
   - Real-time updates visible immediately upon message receipt

### MQTT Data Reception Use Cases

**External Sensor Integration:**
```yaml
Scenario: Weather station data via MQTT
MQTT Topic: "weather/station1/temperature"
Message: "18.5"
XPF Action: Update monitor point "weather/station1/temperature" with value 18.5
Display: Appears immediately in Monitor Points grid
```

**Multi-System Data Collection:**
```yaml
Scenario: Combine Modbus device data with external IoT data
Modbus Data: Poll temperature sensors every 5 seconds
MQTT Data: Receive cloud weather data every 60 seconds  
Combined View: Both data sources visible in same Monitor Points grid
```

**Development & Testing Data Injection:**
```yaml
Scenario: Test monitoring dashboards without hardware
Test Process: Publish simulated sensor data via MQTT
XPF Display: Monitor points populate with test data immediately
Benefits: Full dashboard testing without physical Modbus devices
```

### Security Considerations for MQTT Subscriptions

!!! warning "MQTT Subscription Security"
    **MQTT subscriptions receive external data - implement proper security:**
    
    - ✅ **Use TLS/SSL** for all MQTT connections to prevent data tampering
    - ✅ **Implement authentication** (usernames, certificates) to verify data sources  
    - ✅ **Validate incoming data** formats and ranges before display
    - ✅ **Log all received messages** for audit trails and debugging
    - ✅ **Set topic permissions** carefully to prevent unauthorized data injection
    - ✅ **Monitor data sources** to detect compromised or malfunctioning publishers

### Integration Example: Complete Monitoring Solution

**Comprehensive monitoring setup combining multiple data sources:**

```yaml
Modbus Data Sources:
  - Poll local PLCs every 2 seconds for real-time process data
  - Update monitor points with current production values

MQTT Data Sources:  
  - Subscribe to "weather/+" for environmental data every 5 minutes
  - Subscribe to "energy/grid/+" for utility data every 15 minutes
  - Subscribe to "alarms/external/+" for external system alerts

Unified Display:
  - All data sources appear together in Monitor Points grid
  - Real-time updates from both Modbus polling and MQTT subscriptions
  - No configuration dependencies between data source types
  - Complete system visibility in single XPF instance
```

**For comprehensive MQTT connection setup, see**: [Secure Setup Guide](#secure-setup-guide) and [Complete Setup Examples](#complete-setup-examples) sections above.

## MQTT Communication Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Understanding MQTT Statistics (TxxRxxExx)

**The MQTT statistics display provides real-time insight into communication health:**

**Performance Monitoring:**
```yaml
Healthy Communication Patterns:
  - Steady T counter increases during publishing operations
  - Steady R counter increases when receiving subscribed data
  - E counter remains at zero or very low numbers
  - Counters resume increasing after connection recovery

Warning Indicators:
  - E counter increasing rapidly (connection/authentication issues)
  - T counter not increasing during expected publishing (connection lost)
  - R counter not increasing despite expected incoming data (subscription issues)
  - All counters stopped increasing (communication halted)
```

**Troubleshooting with Statistics:**

| Statistics Pattern | Likely Issue | Resolution |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **T000R000E005+** | Connection/authentication failures | Check broker settings, credentials, network connectivity |
| **T123R000E000** | Publishing works, no received data | Verify subscription topics, check if external publishers are active |
| **T000R089E000** | Receiving data, not publishing | Normal for receive-only configurations, or check publishing setup |
| **T050R025E010** | Mixed success with some errors | Intermittent network issues, check broker stability |
| **T000R000E000** | No activity at all | MQTT not started, or no monitor points configured for publishing |

**Using Statistics for Optimization:**
- **High T, Low R**: Optimize publishing frequency to reduce broker load
- **High R, Low T**: Perfect for data reception applications
- **Increasing E count**: Investigate network stability, authentication, or broker capacity
- **Balanced T/R**: Indicates healthy bidirectional MQTT communication

### Advanced Topic Configuration

### MQTT Topic Structure

Configure topic patterns for publishing and subscribing:

**Publishing Topics (XPF to Broker):**

| Topic Pattern | Example | Data Source | Description |
|---------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Static Topics** | `plant/reactor1/temperature` | Monitor Point 1 | Fixed topic path |
| **Dynamic Topics** | `{UnitID}/holding/{Address}` | Any Monitor Point | Variable substitution |
| **JSON Topics** | `data/json` | Multiple Points | Structured JSON payload |

**Subscription Topics (Broker to XPF):**

| Topic Pattern | Example | Target | Description |
|---------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Control Commands** | `plant/reactor1/setpoint` | Monitor Point Write | Receive control values |
| **Configuration Updates** | `config/+/update` | System Settings | Dynamic configuration |
| **Broadcast Messages** | `alerts/#` | Event Logging | System-wide notifications |

### Configure Topic Mappings

1. **Set Up Publishing**
   - **Topic Template**: Define topic structure with variables
   - **Message Format**: Choose JSON or raw value format
   - **QoS Level**: Select Quality of Service (0, 1, or 2)
   - **Retain Messages**: Enable to store last value for new subscribers

2. **Set Up Subscriptions**
   - **Subscribe Topics**: Define topics to listen for incoming messages
   - **Wildcard Support**: Use `+` (single level) and `#` (multi-level) wildcards
   - **Message Handling**: Configure how received messages update monitor points

3. **Variable Substitution**
   - **{UnitID}**: Replaced with monitor point Unit ID
   - **{Address}**: Replaced with monitor point address
   - **{Name}**: Replaced with monitor point name
   - **{Value}**: Replaced with current monitor point value

!!! tip "Monitor Points Configuration"
    **Need to configure monitor points first?** See the comprehensive [Monitor Points Configuration](../products/xpf/user-guide.md#7-monitor-points-configuration) section in the main user guide.

### Example Topic Configurations

**Industrial Process Monitoring:**
```yaml
Publishing Topics:
  - "plant/line1/temperature" - Temperature sensor data
  - "plant/line1/pressure" - Pressure measurement
  - "plant/line1/flow" - Flow rate data

Subscription Topics:
  - "plant/line1/setpoints/+" - Receive setpoint changes
  - "commands/emergency/#" - Emergency stop commands
```

**Multi-Device Installation:**
```yaml
Publishing Topics:
  - "devices/{UnitID}/data/{Address}" - Dynamic device data
  - "status/devices" - JSON status summary

Subscription Topics:
  - "config/devices/{UnitID}/+" - Device-specific configuration
  - "commands/broadcast" - System-wide commands
```

### Advanced Message Format Configuration

**For detailed message mapping and publishing options beyond the basic tutorials:**

| Message Format | Content Example | Use Case |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Raw Value** | `25.4` | Simple numeric publishing |
| **JSON Object** | `{"value": 25.4, "timestamp": "2025-11-05T14:30:15Z", "unit": "C"}` | Structured data with metadata |
| **Custom JSON** | `{"temperature": 25.4, "status": "normal"}` | Application-specific format |

**Advanced Configuration Options:**
- **Individual Topics**: Each monitor point gets its own topic
- **Batched Topics**: Multiple points in single JSON message
- **Filtered Publishing**: Only publish when values change
- **QoS Settings**: Configure Quality of Service (0, 1, or 2)

## Testing and Verification Tools

!!! info "Documentation Approach"
    **This guide uses external tools (MQTT Explorer) for verification screenshots to provide clear visual separation between:**
    - **XPF** = Publisher/Subscriber (the main application)  
    - **MQTT Explorer** = External verification tool (for documentation clarity)
    
    **In real-world usage, you can use XPF's built-in test tools exclusively** - no external applications needed!

### XPF's Built-in MQTT Test Tools

**XPF includes integrated MQTT testing capabilities** that save hours of setup time and eliminate the need for separate test applications:

!!! success "Built-in Test Features"

    - Send test messages to verify subscription handling  
    - Monitor message flow directly in XPF console
    - Debug topic mapping and message formatting issues
    
    **Real-time Message Monitoring**
    - View live MQTT traffic (TX/RX counters)
    - Console logging with timestamped message details
    - Connection status indicators and error reporting
    - Quality of Service (QoS) confirmation tracking
    
    **Rapid Development Workflow**
    - Configure > Test > Debug > Deploy in single application
    - No context switching between multiple tools
    - Immediate feedback on configuration changes
    - Built-in message validation and formatting checks

### External Verification Tools (For Documentation Clarity)

**In this guide, we use MQTT Explorer as external verification** to clearly show the separation between XPF (publisher/subscriber) and verification tool:

| Tool Role | Application | Purpose in Guide |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **MQTT Publisher** | **XPF (Client Mode)** | Sending Modbus data to broker |
| **MQTT Subscriber** | **XPF (Server Mode)** | Receiving commands from broker |
| **Verification Tool** | **MQTT Explorer** | Visual confirmation of message flow |

**Why MQTT Explorer for Documentation:**

- **Visual Clarity**: Tree view shows topic structure clearly
- **Popular & Free**: Most widely used MQTT test client  
- **Clean Interface**: Perfect for screenshots and tutorials
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows/Mac/Linux compatibility
- **No Registration**: Immediate download and use

**MQTT Explorer TLS Support:**

- **Basic TLS/SSL**: Supports standard TLS connections (port 8883)
- **CA Certificates**: Can validate broker certificates
- **Username/Password over TLS**: Works with HiveMQ Cloud
- **Client Certificates**: No mutual TLS support
- **Advanced PKI**: Limited certificate management

!!! note "For Advanced TLS"
    For client certificate examples, we'll use **HiveMQ WebSocket Client** (built into broker dashboard) or **XPF's built-in tools**, as MQTT Explorer doesn't support mutual TLS authentication.

!!! tip "Real-World Usage"
    **In production, you can use XPF's built-in test tools exclusively** - no external applications needed! We use MQTT Explorer in this guide only to provide clear visual separation for learning purposes.

      - In EMQX console, go to **Deployment Overview**
      - Find **MQTT Connection Information** section
      - Click **CA Certificate** download link
      - Save the certificate file (e.g., `emqx-ca.crt`)

#### Step 2: Configure XPF with EMQX CA Certificate


1. **Open XPF MQTT Settings**
   ```yaml
   Basic Configuration:
     Broker Host: caxxxx4e.ala.us-east-1.emqxsl.com (your endpoint)
     Port: 8883 (TLS/SSL port)
     Client ID: XPF-EMQX-Device001
     Username: (EMQX username)
     Password: (EMQX password)
   ```

2. **Configure CA Certificate**
   
      - Enable **TLS/SSL** checkbox
      - Click **CA Certificate** button (file certificate icon)
      - Browse to downloaded `emqx-ca.crt` file
      - Select the certificate file
      - XPF displays certificate path

#### Step 3: Test EMQX Connection

1. **Verify Certificate Configuration**
   
      - CA Certificate path should be displayed in XPF
      - TLS/SSL should be enabled
      - All connection details should be entered

2. **Connect and Verify**

      - Click **Connect** - should show **"Connected (TLS)"**
      - Check MQTT Debug Log for certificate validation:
      ```
      Certificate validation approved. Errors: None.
      Subject: CN=*.ala.us-east-1.emqxsl.com
      TLS encryption enabled. Using protocol: Tls12
      Connected to MQTT Broker
      ```

3. **Verify in EMQX Console**
   
      - Go to EMQX deployment **Monitor** section
      - Check **Connections** - should see your Client ID connected
      - Verify connection shows as secure/encrypted

!!! success "EMQX CA Setup Complete!"
    **Benefits of using downloaded CA certificate:**
    - ✅ **Explicit trust chain** - You control which CA to trust
    - ✅ **No auto-detect vulnerabilities** - Prevents potential CA spoofing
    - ✅ **Certificate expiry tracking** - You know when CA cert expires (2031.11.09 in example)
    - ✅ **Compliance ready** - Explicit certificate management for auditing

### Example 4: Advanced TLS with Client Certificates

**For high-security environments** requiring mutual TLS authentication.

#### When to Use Client Certificates

- **Industrial environments** with strict security policies
- **Multi-tenant brokers** requiring device authentication
- **Compliance requirements** (ISO 27001, IEC 62443)
- **Zero-trust networks** where identity verification is mandatory

#### Step 1: Generate Client Certificates

**Option A: Use OpenSSL (Self-Signed)**
```bash
# Generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client-key.pem -pkcs8

# Generate certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key client-key.pem -out client.csr \
  -subj "/CN=XPF-Plant1-Device001/O=YourCompany/C=US"

# Generate self-signed certificate
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -signkey client-key.pem \
  -out client-cert.pem -days 365
```

**Option B: Use Your PKI/CA System**

  - Generate certificate through your organization's PKI
  - Ensure certificate includes **Client Authentication** key usage
  - Common Name should match your device identifier

#### Step 2: Convert to PFX Format (Windows)

XPF requires PFX format for client certificates:

```bash
# Combine certificate and private key into PFX
openssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx \
  -inkey client-key.pem -in client-cert.pem \
  -name "XPF-Plant1-Device001"
# Enter export password when prompted
```

#### Step 3: Configure XPF with Client Certificate

1. **TLS Configuration**:
   
      - **TLS/SSL**: Checked
      - **CA Certificate**: `ca.crt` (broker's CA certificate)
      - **Client Certificate**: `client.pfx` (your device certificate)
      - **Certificate Password**: (PFX password from Step 2)

2. **Broker Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   Broker Host: secure-broker.yourcompany.com
   Port: 8883
   Client ID: XPF-Plant1-Device001  # Must match certificate CN
   Username: (may be required depending on broker)
   Password: (may be required depending on broker)
   ```

#### Step 4: Verify Mutual TLS

1. **Connection Log Should Show**:
   ```
   [INFO] TLS Handshake successful
   [INFO] Client certificate presented
   [INFO] Mutual authentication completed
   [INFO] Connected to secure-broker.yourcompany.com:8883
   ```

2. **Broker Logs Should Confirm**:
   - Client certificate validation successful
   - Device authenticated via certificate
   - Connection authorized for configured topics

!!! warning "Certificate Management"
    - **Monitor expiration dates** - Set calendar reminders
    - **Secure private keys** - Store PFX files securely
    - **Test certificate renewal** before expiration
    - **Backup certificates** in secure location
