## Overview

The MQTT Add-on extends Modbus Monitor Advanced with professional IoT capabilities, enabling real-time data publishing to cloud platforms, enterprise message brokers, and custom dashboards.

**How It Works:**

Modbus Monitor Advanced can read data from **any local source** (Modbus TCP servers, serial devices, Bluetooth adapters, sensors, or simulated data) through **three communication channels**—and automatically publish everything to your cloud MQTT broker. No databases, servers, or coding required. Perfect for remote monitoring, edge computing, and IoT dashboards.

**Data Flow Example:**
```
Local Modbus Server (TCP/IP, USB Serial, or Bluetooth)
        ↓
Modbus Monitor Advanced (reads data every polling cycle)
        ↓
MQTT Add-on (transforms data to JSON)
        ↓
Cloud MQTT Broker (HiveMQ, AWS IoT, Azure, Mosquitto, etc.)
        ↓
Dashboards, Analytics, Mobile Apps, Alerts
```

### Step 4: Manually Publish Test Data

1. In MQTT Console, tap **Publish** button
2. Configure publish settings:
      - **Topic**: `modbusmonitor/temperature`
      - **Payload**: `75.3` (sample temperature value)
3. Tap **Send**
4. Data is now published to the broker for remote subscribers

=== "Verify in Modbus Monitor Advanced"

    **Verify directly inside the app—no external tools required:**

    1. In the same MQTT Console where you published
    2. Find the **Subscribe** section (or **Subscriptions** tab)
    3. Enter the topic: `modbusmonitor/temperature`
    4. Tap **Subscribe**
    5. Watch the console—you'll see incoming messages in real-time:
       ```
       Subscribed to: modbusmonitor/temperature
       Message: 75.3
       ```
    6. When finished, tap **Unsubscribe** to stop listening
    ![MQTT Subscribe Verify](../assets/screenshots/android-advanced/mma-addon-mqtt-topic-subscribe.webp){.screenshot-center loading="lazy"}

=== "Verify using MQTT Explorer (or similar)"

    **Verify using an external MQTT tool on your computer:**

    - Open MQTT Explorer or similar tool on your computer
    - Connect to `broker.hivemq.com`
    - Subscribe to `modbusmonitor/#` (wildcard to see all topics)
    - You should see: `modbusmonitor/temperature` = `75.3`

### Step 5: Configure Automatic Publishing

**Now let's automate this so data publishes continuously:**

1. Go back to Monitor Points list
2. Tap your monitor point (e.g., `temperature`) → **Change**
3. Confirm TCP/IP, Modbus TCP, and data type settings are correct
4. Tap **OK** to return to list

💡 **Tip**: If your values aren't updating correctly, review [:octicons-book-24: Advanced Guide → Troubleshooting Monitor Points](../products/android/advanced-guide.md#common-issues-solutions)

5. Open **Hamburger Menu** → **Settings** → **MQTT**
6. Configure MQTT settings:
   - **Enable MQTT**: Toggle ON
   - **Broker Host**: `broker.hivemq.com`
   - **Port**: `1883`
   - **Client ID**: `android-modbus-monitor`
   - **Base Topic**: `modbus/monitor` (auto-appends point name or `/batch`)
   - **Publish Mode**: Choose:
     - **Individual Topics**: Each point publishes separately (e.g., `.../temperature`, `.../pressure`)
     - **Batch JSON**: All points in one message (e.g., `.../batch`)
   - **QoS**: `0` (for testing) or `1` (for reliability)

7. Tap **Save** to apply settings

### Step 6: Start Real-Time Publishing

1. Return to main screen with your Monitor Point
2. Tap the **Link icon** to start Client Mode
   - App begins polling the Modbus server every cycle
   - Data updates are displayed in real-time
   - MQTT automatically publishes after each complete polling cycle

3. **Watch in MQTT Explorer:**
   - You'll see `modbusmonitor/tank1/temperature` update in real-time
   - Each time the polling cycle completes, a new value publishes
   - Example sequence: `75.3` → `75.5` → `76.1` → (repeating)

### Step 7: Stop Communication

1. Tap the **Link icon** again to halt Client Mode
2. Polling stops and MQTT publishing stops
3. Last published values remain in broker (subscribers see last-known values)

### Step 8: View Published Data Flow

**What's Happening Behind the Scenes:**

```
[Polling Cycle]
1. App connects to Modbus server
2. Requests holding register 400001 (2 registers)
3. Server responds with raw data
4. App converts to FLOAT32 → "75.3"
5. [MQTT Automatically Publishes]
6. Data sent to HiveMQ broker
7. Remote subscribers (MQTT Explorer) receive: "modbus/monitor/temperature = 75.3"
8. Repeat cycle every ~1000ms (configurable)
```

## Data Sources: Three Communication Channels

Modbus Monitor Advanced can read data from **any of three communication channels**, and MQTT will seamlessly publish all data to your cloud broker without any additional configuration.

📖 **For complete channel documentation**, see [:octicons-book-24: Advanced Guide → Communication Channels](../products/android/advanced-guide.md#channel-settings)

### Channel 1: TCP/IP (WiFi/Ethernet)

**Best For**: Remote Modbus servers, industrial equipment on network, desktop applications

**Setup:**

- Server IP: `192.168.1.100` (or public IP if remote)
- Port: `502` (Modbus TCP standard) or custom port like `8888`
- Protocol: `Modbus TCP`, `Modbus UDP`
- Perfect for: Factory equipment, SCADA systems, remote gateways

**MQTT Publishing:**

```
Data Flow: Remote Server (TCP/IP) → Android App → MQTT Broker → Dashboard
Example: Industrial PLC reading temperature → Android polling → HiveMQ cloud
```

### Channel 2: USB-OTG Serial (Hardwired)

**Best For**: Direct serial connections, legacy equipment, RS232/RS485 devices

**Setup:**

- USB adapter: FTDI, Prolific, or SiLab chipset
- Protocol: `Modbus RTU`, `Modbus ASCII`
- Physical cable from Android to device (5m max)
- Perfect for: Field service, equipment commissioning, portable diagnostics

**MQTT Publishing:**
```
Data Flow: Serial Device (RS232/485) → USB Adapter → Android → MQTT Broker
Example: Energy meter on RS485 → USB converter → Android → Cloud MQTT → Analytics
```

### Channel 3: Bluetooth (Wireless)

**Best For**: Wireless connections, portable devices, flexible range monitoring

**Setup:**

- Bluetooth serial adapter (tested: SIIG, Broadcom)
- Protocol: `Modbus RTU`, `Modbus ASCII` (wireless)
- Range: 10–30 meters (line of sight)
- Perfect for: Warehouse scanning, mobile equipment monitoring, IoT sensors

**MQTT Publishing:**
```
Data Flow: Bluetooth Device → Android (wireless) → MQTT Broker → Mobile App
Example: Bluetooth sensor in storage → Android warehouse device → AWS IoT → Alerts
```

### Multi-Channel Configuration Example

**Scenario: Monitor everything simultaneously**

You can create multiple monitor points, each using a different channel:

| Monitor Point | Channel | Source | MQTT Topic |
|---------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Tank Level | **TCP/IP** | Factory PLC (192.168.1.100:502) | `factory/tank_level` |
| Motor Speed | **Serial (USB)** | VFD via RS485 converter | `factory/motor_speed` |
| Ambient Temp | **Bluetooth** | Wireless sensor in room | `warehouse/temp_ambient` |

**Automatic Publishing:**
All three data sources are polled every cycle and published to the MQTT broker in a single batch message:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-26T14:30:22Z",
  "device_id": "android-factory-01",
  "points": [
    {"name": "Tank Level", "value": 75.3, "channel": "TCP/IP"},
    {"name": "Motor Speed", "value": 1450, "channel": "Serial"},
    {"name": "Ambient Temp", "value": 22.5, "channel": "Bluetooth"}
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Connection Failed** | Wrong host/port | Verify broker details; check firewall |
| **Authentication Error** | Invalid credentials | Confirm username/password; check broker logs |
| **No Data Published** | MQTT disabled or Client Mode stopped | Enable MQTT toggle; start polling |
| **Messages Not Received** | Wrong topic subscription | Check topic structure; verify wildcards (`#`, `+`) |

### Testing MQTT Connection

**Using Mosquitto CLI:**
```bash
# Subscribe to all topics
mosquitto_sub -h broker.example.com -p 1883 -t "modbus/#" -u username -P password

# Test publish
mosquitto_pub -h broker.example.com -p 1883 -t "modbus/test" -m "hello" -u username -P password
```

**Using MQTT Explorer (GUI):**
1. Download MQTT Explorer
2. Add connection with your broker details
3. Subscribe to `#` (all topics)
4. Start app polling and watch for published messages

## Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "What's the difference between point topics and batch JSON?"
    **Point Topics**: Each monitor point publishes to its own topic (e.g., `modbus/device01/tank_level`). Good for subscribing to specific values.
    
    **Batch JSON**: All monitor points in a single JSON message to one topic (e.g., `modbus/device01/batch`). Efficient for dashboards displaying multiple values.
    
    You can enable both modes simultaneously.

??? question "How often does MQTT publish?"
    MQTT publishes automatically after each complete polling cycle through all monitor points. Polling interval is controlled by Settings → Timing → Poll Interval (default 1000ms).

??? question "Does MQTT work with Sensor Server mode?"
    Yes! Sensor values (accelerometer, gyro, etc.) are published just like Modbus monitor points. Topic names use the sensor name.

??? question "Can I use MQTT without internet?"
    Yes, if you have a local MQTT broker (Mosquitto, HiveMQ) on your LAN. The app only needs network access to the broker, not internet.

??? question "What happens if the broker goes offline?"
    Messages are not queued or cached. When the broker reconnects, publishing resumes from the current cycle. For critical data retention, use the Google Sheets Add-on for logging.

??? question "How do I secure my MQTT connection?"
    1. Use TLS/SSL (port 8883)
    2. Enable client certificate authentication (mutual TLS)
    3. Use strong passwords
    4. Restrict broker access by IP/firewall
    5. Set appropriate QoS levels

??? question "Can multiple Android devices publish to the same broker?"
    Yes. Use unique Client IDs and topic prefixes for each device to avoid collisions. Example: `modbus/device01/`, `modbus/device02/`, etc.

## Best Practices

**Topic Design:**

- Use hierarchical structure: `company/site/area/device/point`
- Include device ID for multi-device deployments
- Keep topic names short and descriptive
- Use lowercase with underscores: `tank_level` not `Tank Level`

**Performance:**

- Poll interval ≥ 1000ms for stable networks
- Use batch JSON for >10 monitor points
- QoS 0 for high-frequency non-critical data
- QoS 1 for important values

**Security:**

- Always use TLS/SSL for cloud brokers
- Rotate credentials periodically
- Use read-only credentials where possible
- Monitor broker logs for unauthorized access

**Reliability:**

- Test connection before deployment
- Set up broker monitoring/alerts
- Document topic structure for team
- Keep backup of configuration
