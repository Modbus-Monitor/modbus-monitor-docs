    - Real-time logging with CSV export
    - Cloud integration (Google Sheets, MQTT)
    - Advanced data transformations and math functions
    - [Your unique features]
    - Professional support and documentation
    
    QModMaster is best for occasional manual frame testing; [Your Product] is built for production monitoring and data workflows.

??? question "Can I use Python libraries with [Your Product]?"
    Absolutely! Many users run `pymodbus` automation scripts that write data to Modbus registers, then use **[Your Product]** to monitor, visualize, and publish that data to cloud dashboards. This separation keeps automation logic clean while providing powerful monitoring.

??? question "Should I use ModScan or [Your Product] for Windows?"
    **[Your Product]** offers a modern interface with features ModScan lacks:
    
    - Multi-protocol support (TCP, RTU, ASCII, UDP, RTU over TCP)
    - Real-time cloud publishing
    - Advanced data transformations
    - Mobile companion apps (if applicable)
    - Active development and support
    
    ModScan remains useful for legacy workflows where established procedures reference it specifically.

??? question "Are these tools compatible with each other?"
    Yes! All Modbus tools speak the same protocol. You can:
    
    - Use **[Your Product]** as a Modbus server, poll it with QModMaster for verification
    - Run pymodbus scripts writing to devices, monitor with **[Your Product]**
    - Test configurations in QModMaster, deploy production monitoring with **[Your Product]**

## Defensive Messaging

### If Users Ask About Competitors
**Script**: "We respect the Modbus tool ecosystem. [Competitor] is great for [specific use case], but [Your Product] is optimized for [your strength]. Many users run both for [complementary workflow]. What's your primary use case—we can recommend the best fit."

### If Concerned About Link Leakage
- Use `rel="nofollow"` (prevents authority flow)
- Link only to docs/GitHub, not commercial pages
- Position your product first in every comparison
- Maintain 5:1 ratio of internal to external links on page
- Track outbound clicks in analytics to measure actual leakage

---

## Analytics & Tracking

### Recommended Event Tracking
```javascript
// Track outbound clicks (Google Analytics example)
document.querySelectorAll('a[rel="nofollow"]').forEach(link => {
  link.addEventListener('click', () => {
    gtag('event', 'outbound_click', {
      'link_url': link.href,
      'link_text': link.textContent
    });
  });
});
```

### Monitor These Metrics
- **Bounce rate** on ecosystem page (should be lower than avg—shows engagement)
- **Time on page** (longer = reading comparisons = qualified interest)
- **Outbound click rate** (should be <10% of page views)
- **Conversion from ecosystem page** (track download/purchase clicks after viewing)
- **Search queries** (monitor if ranking for "[competitor] alternative" increases)
